# ISLAMU Event

Self-hostable, open-source event discovery and management software for communities, organizations, and platform operators.

ISLAMU Event powers ISLAMU’s Islamic events instance, but the software itself is purpose-agnostic, white-label, and designed to be rebranded for any event ecosystem.

> Pre-1.0 notice: ISLAMU Event is still before v1. Breaking changes may happen between releases. We avoid data-loss-class breaks where possible, but configuration changes may be required.

## Quick Start (For Developers & Contributors)

For local development and code contribution, launch the .NET Aspire developer loop:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/islamu-ngo/Event.git
cd Event
cp .env.example .env
curl -sSL https://aspire.dev/install.sh | bash # only needed when aspire CLI is not installed
aspire run --apphost Explore.AppHost/Explore.AppHost.csproj
```

This automatically orchestrates PostgreSQL, Keycloak, Mailpit, `Explore.API`, `Explore.Blazor`, and the Aspire dashboard (`http://localhost:18888`).

For Docker-only local development:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose config
docker compose up -d postgres redis keycloak-db keycloak keycloak-init islamu-event-api islamu-event-ui
```

### Contributor Onboarding Path
1. Review our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Local Getting Started](docs/internal/GETTING_STARTED.md).
2. Read the [Developer Guide](docs/internal/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for the 5-minute mental model and coding patterns.
3. Check the authoritative [Quick Reference (Invariants)](docs/internal/QUICK_REFERENCE.md), [Clean Architecture Invariants](docs/internal/ARCHITECTURE.md), and [Governance Standards](docs/internal/GOVERNANCE.md).
4. AI-assisted coding agents must strictly follow [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and [`.agents/contract/intents.yaml`](.agents/contract/intents.yaml).

### ✍️ Contributor License Agreement & Community Protection

All non-bot contributors must sign the [ISLAMU Contributor License Agreement][cla-link] before a pull request can be merged. Signing is handled automatically directly in your PR with a simple comment reply—see [`legal/CLA.md`][cla-link] for full terms.

> **🛡️ Why We Have a CLA & Why You Can Trust It:**
> * **Community-First Invariant:** Contributors retain ownership of their contributions. The CLA grants ISLAMU inbound rights so the non-profit can offer alternative licensing for enterprise compliance on private internal networks.
> * **The Anti-SaaS Covenant:** ISLAMU is bound by a strict governance commitment **never to grant an alternative license permitting a third party to operate a closed-source, proprietary SaaS or cloud service**. 
> * **Universal Parity:** Any company offering ISLAMU Event as a public SaaS must do so under `AGPL-3.0-or-later`, guaranteeing that all SaaS improvements are shared back with the community. Your contributions will never be locked behind a proprietary vendor wall.

## 🌱 Sustainability

ISLAMU is built by one person — **Amir Akrari** — entirely on personal free time and personal funds.

**ISLAMU (ASBL en formation)** (Association Sans But Lucratif — a non-profit association in formation in Belgium) is being established as the operational and legal steward of all ISLAMU open-source projects and charitable activities. Once formally registered with legal personality, ISLAMU ASBL will assume full legal stewardship.

### How ISLAMU sustains itself

ISLAMU will not offer its open-source software as a hosted SaaS. Instead, sustainability is built on:

- **Fundraising & Grants:** Crowdfunding campaigns, foundation grants, and public-interest funding for open-source digital infrastructure
- **Sponsorships:** Ranked sponsorship tiers — sponsors receive recognition and visibility; every euro goes back into the non-profit
- **Official Partnerships & Fleet Tooling:** Organizations that want to offer ISLAMU software as a hosted service can become **Official ISLAMU Partners**. Partners are vetted, listed on the ISLAMU website, and actively recommended and marketed by ISLAMU. Official Partners receive access to **ISLAMU Event Control Plane** (our standalone fleet orchestrator that bridges multiple ISLAMU Event instances with PaaS engines like Coolify for automated provisioning, SLA management, and backups). ISLAMU does not compete with its partners by running a commercial SaaS; we empower our partners with tooling and referrals
- **Consultation & Support** — professional consulting around ISLAMU software deployment, customization, and integration

## 📄 License & Ecosystem Architecture

This project is licensed under the terms of [GNU AGPL-3.0-or-later][license-link].

### 🌐 The Three-Pillar Ecosystem

ISLAMU Event operates on a transparent three-pillar model designed for universal community parity and sustainable open-source governance:

1. **Community Commons (`AGPL-3.0-or-later`):** 100% Free & Open Source for everyone. Any organization or hoster can run a SaaS or self-host under AGPLv3. All SaaS modifications must be published openly, ensuring complete community parity.
2. **Enterprise Internal-Use License (Anti-SaaS):** For enterprises whose internal compliance policies ban AGPL copyleft on private internal infrastructure. This license waives Section 13 network copyleft for private on-premises/VPC deployments and internal corporate events, while **strictly forbidding external SaaS or commercial cloud hosting**. Paid for commercial corporations (funding security audits and maintainers); gratis ($0) for verified non-profits and educational institutions.
3. **Official Partner Program:** For certified agencies, hosters, and integrators. Partners operate on the exact same 100% AGPLv3 codebase (no proprietary code privilege). Commercial value is generated through quality certification, trust branding, and official directory listings.

For the full ethical and strategic design analysis, see the [I-VSD Strategy Review](islamic-value-sensitive-design/i-vsd-licensing-and-commercial-strategy.md).

### Standalone Core And Optional Services

The minimum operational deployment is the single `Event.Standalone` image: the ISLAMU Event API and Blazor BFF/UI run in one process with SQLite persistence. Application, Data Protection, and embedded privacy-erasure migrations run in that process before it accepts traffic. PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MariaDB, MySQL, Redis, Keycloak, Cerbos, MinIO/S3, SMTP/Mailpit, Svix, Weblate, Formbricks, Coop, Osprey, AI providers, federation services, and external observability backends are optional capabilities, not requirements of the standalone core.

The AGPL-3.0-or-later license and any alternative license offered by ISLAMU apply only to material that ISLAMU owns or is authorized to license. Third-party libraries, container images, services, datasets, fonts, and other assets retain their respective licenses, public-domain status, and other applicable terms. Including an optional integration or deployment manifest in this repository does not relicense that third-party material. See the [Self-Hosting Technical Specs](docs/internal/SELF_HOSTING.md#third-party-software-and-license-boundary) and [release dependency policy](docs/internal/CI_CD_GOVERNANCE.md#standalone-and-optional-service-license-boundary).
