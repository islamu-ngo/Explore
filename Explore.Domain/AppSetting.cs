// ABOUTME: Entity for storing encrypted operational configuration settings with key versioning.

/// - Values are encrypted using AES-256-GCM before storage
/// - Supports key versioning for encryption key rotation
/// - Protected by check constraint: cannot store high-value secrets (Database:*, Security:MasterKey*)
/// - For high-value secrets, use the secret manager (Infisical, Vault, etc.)
