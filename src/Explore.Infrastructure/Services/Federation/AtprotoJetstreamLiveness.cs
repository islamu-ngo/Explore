/// (<c>community.lexicon.calendar.*</c>) are rare network-wide — sampling the public archive showed
/// roughly two calendar records per two million firehose events — so a healthy consumer can legitimately
/// sit idle for hours. Treating "no recent event" as unhealthy would alarm constantly; treating
/// "no open subscription" as unhealthy is the signal that actually distinguishes broken from quiet.

/// For the same reason there is no seq-lag gauge here: the sealed archive tip counts every collection on
