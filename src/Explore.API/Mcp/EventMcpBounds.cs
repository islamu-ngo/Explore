/// Every bound an MCP tool applies before serializing a response. They live together because they are one
/// contract, not thirty independent numbers: each caps how much of the platform a single AI-facing call can
/// observe, and a response trimmed by any of them must say so through its truncation indicators.
/// <para>
/// Raising one of these widens what an assistant can pull in a single turn, so changes belong in review
/// alongside the AI disclosure rules rather than being adjusted at a call site.
