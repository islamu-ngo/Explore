/// <summary>
/// Most DTO families assemble the same way: run the detail policy over one resource, the collection policy
/// over a page, and let <see cref="ResourceAssemblerBase{TDto,TListDto}"/> batch and de-duplicate the
/// authorization calls. Those families used to each declare an empty subclass that added nothing but a
/// constructor signature — a type per family whose only job was to be a distinct type.
/// <para>
/// This generic is that default made explicit. A family that genuinely needs custom assembly still declares
/// its own subclass and registers it, so the file list now distinguishes families with real assembly behavior
/// from families that simply have HAL links.
