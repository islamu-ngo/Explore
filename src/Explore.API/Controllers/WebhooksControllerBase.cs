/// <summary>
/// Webhook collections are addressable by owner, and the owner is the tenant-scoped subject a caller is
/// actually allowed to see — not whatever owner id the query string carried. Resolving that scope in one place
/// keeps every webhook collection route, and therefore every HAL pagination link, anchored to authorized
/// ownership rather than to request input.
/// <para>
/// The resolver throwing when scope is absent is deliberate: reaching link construction without a resolved
/// scope means authorization did not run, and emitting a link in that state would leak an addressable
/// collection URL for an owner the caller may not have.
