/// Resolution order:
/// 1. Check if tenant customization is enabled at instance level
/// 2. Check for tenant-specific BYO Cerbos override (custom endpoint)
/// 3. Fall back to the instance's Cerbos PDP endpoint

/// SaaS scenarios supported:
/// - Instance admin locks Cerbos settings → all tenants use the instance PDP
/// - Instance admin enables customization → tenants can bring their own Cerbos PDP
/// - Default: all tenants use instance PDP with scope-based policy isolation
