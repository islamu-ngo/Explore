/// Standalone-only composition for the Quartz.NET dashboard.
/// <para>
/// The dashboard is a Blazor Server app that reaches the scheduler in-process, so it can only exist where Razor
/// components and <c>IScheduler</c> share a process — the combined host. The split-mode API host deliberately
/// carries no Razor infrastructure and therefore never mounts it; split-mode operators use the first-party
/// scheduler administration section instead, which is served over the normal HAL API.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The <em>self-contained</em> mapping is used rather than the documented "existing Blazor app" overload. That
/// overload expects the host's <c>Router</c> to resolve the dashboard's attribute-routed pages through
/// <c>AdditionalAssemblies</c>. This application routes through Blazouter's explicit route table, which resolves
/// only components listed in it and has no attribute-route fallback, so the overload would render the app's
/// not-found page at every dashboard path. The self-contained mapping brings the dashboard's own root component
/// and route table, leaving it independent of the host's router — and it keeps every dashboard component out of
/// the shared client project, which is also compiled into the WebAssembly bundle.
