# I-VSD Event Ticketing Lifecycle Planning Review

Last Updated: 2026-08-29

## Review Metadata

- Mode: planning
- Subject: event ticketing lifecycle after registration-form delivery
- Workstream: `event-ticketing-lifecycle`
- Report kind: implementation-planning review
- Report status: current
- Disposition: plan-aligned
- Evidence cutoff: 2026-08-29
- Evidence-packet revision: SHA-256 source-packet manifest `c06e94970f738b8fc20b89895f0425c8ca186b85a0184647fd97cfddbcfeb792`
- Reviewed input revision: plan SHA-256 `3e1d8d0f42a7739e22a685bfc677a8d3e7db82ea00cddd4cd0caefcee1141986`; tasks SHA-256 `d395d927043a639d2ff1f7b75a5f857c7102615212290ddd40ef7b91b1bdf669`
- Revalidation result: every accepted finding and mitigation remains mapped to S1-S7/WB-1 and Tasks 1.1-9.4; the Phase 7 add-on interpretation below makes catalog cardinality, optionality, commerce, fulfillment, refund, and admission boundaries explicit without widening protected payout or specialist-system scope
- Refresh trigger: any material change to access/ceiling authority, participant consent, transfer/resale, waitlist/refund priority, add-on admission separation, recovery/key custody, monetization/payout, or mapped scenarios/tasks
- Supersedes: future-work mappings F6–F13 in `i-vsd-registration-data-collection.md`; that report remains authoritative for completed registration/forms/commerce/admission findings F1–F5

## Scope

This report covers provider-controlled design decisions for the successor workstream that begins after the completed Registration Data Collection Phase 21 boundary:

- authenticated, verified-email guest, and name-only registration access;
- monotonic instance/tenant/event purchase ceilings and explicit purchaser actor context;
- order-level versus participant-level requirement scope, consent, approval, and admission readiness;
- ticket transfer, claim, correction, reissue, and credential rotation;
- deterministic waitlist and conditional fair-return reallocation;
- optional event-bound add-ons;
- recovery, deployment capability truth, and explicitly unavailable protected delayed payout.

Completed authoring/provider/payment/refund/admission/check-in implementation remains evidence and dependency, not new scope.

## Claim Boundary

This is Islamic Value-Sensitive Design reasoning about provider responsibility in a self-hostable event platform. It is not a fatwa, Sharia certification, halal/haram ruling, legal opinion, payment-services approval, privacy/security certification, accessibility certification, or proof of implementation effectiveness.

Qualified Sunni scholarly authority owns religious-legal conclusions. Legal, provider-contract, privacy, security, accessibility, stakeholder, and operational claims require their own accountable reviewers and evidence.

#### Phase 7 Add-On Model Interpretation

The approved product model is an event-owned **catalog containing zero or more add-on items**, not one event-level add-on scalar. An organizer may offer multiple independently governed items, and a buyer may explicitly select zero, one, or several distinct items. Where the catalog item permits quantity, one selected item may produce a quantity greater than one. No item is preselected or required as a condition of admission.

The following provider-controlled boundaries are mandatory:

1. **Catalog and organizer authority**
   - Every catalog item is tenant- and event-qualified and has its own UUIDv7 identity, immutable commercial lineage, currency, integer-minor-unit price, availability, inventory facts, and active/retired sales state.
   - Organizers may change or retire future-sale catalog facts only through authorized server actions. A later edit never rewrites a purchased line, prior disclosure, merchant, currency, price, refund basis, or fulfillment promise.
   - The implementation supports a collection of organizer-defined items. The exact organizer catalog-management routes and UI remain a Phase 7 design/acceptance detail and must not be silently omitted from a claim that organizers can manage add-ons.

2. **Buyer choice and anti-manipulation**
   - A mixed registration order may contain ticket lines and separate add-on lines, but the UI must expose each add-on as an affirmative opt-in with its unit price, quantity, subtotal, fulfillment expectation, and refund treatment before provider handoff.
   - No prechecked selection, hidden bundle, misleading scarcity timer, obstructive decline path, or required add-on disguised as optional is permitted.
   - Browser affordances come only from HAL links. Server authorization, inventory, price, and lifecycle rules remain authoritative even if a browser fabricates a request.

3. **Immutable line and money truth**
   - Each selected add-on becomes a separate immutable order-line snapshot carrying the catalog lineage and buyer-visible commercial facts accepted at checkout.
   - Money uses checked `long` minor units only. Unit multiplication, line addition, order aggregation, and refund allocation must fail before persistence, inventory mutation, outbox creation, or provider effects when they overflow.
   - Expected totals are independently testable literal values. Every valid refund allocation is non-negative and sums exactly to the captured or refunded add-on amount; no rounding remainder may disappear or be manufactured.

4. **Independent inventory and one-winner allocation**
   - Add-on inventory is not ticket capacity. Concurrent buyers contending for the last unit must produce exactly one winner under tenant-qualified database authority, with complete loser rollback and no oversell.
   - An add-on inventory loss, cancellation, or release never consumes, creates, releases, or reallocates admission capacity.

5. **Independent fulfillment and replay**
   - Add-on fulfillment has durable, idempotent state separate from payment, registration completion, ticket issuance, and check-in.
   - Duplicate or restarted fulfillment work returns or converges on the existing outcome; it cannot deliver twice or manufacture completion from a browser/provider return.
   - Fulfillment modes, variants, bundles, scheduling, and whether inventory may be explicitly unlimited are not yet specified. They remain unavailable until modeled and reviewed rather than being inferred from generic catalog fields.

6. **Line-specific cancellation and refund**
   - Cancelling or partially refunding an add-on operates on the add-on line and its captured value. It never cancels the ticket, revokes an admission credential, changes participant readiness, or changes ticket ownership.
   - Refund requests use durable idempotency and truthful provider reconciliation. Requested or pending is never displayed as succeeded.
   - Marketing, bookkeeping, accounting, tax determination, and legal invoice or credit-note issuance remain external specialist-system responsibilities.

7. **Admission separation ratchet**
   - Add-on purchase, inventory, fulfillment, cancellation, and refund code must have no transition path that creates, revokes, rotates, or otherwise alters `AdmissionTicket`, admission credentials, check-in history, participant readiness, or ticket capacity.
   - Architecture and persistence tests must make this a forward-only ratchet, not a convention enforced only by review.

The currently approved R5 scenario guarantees optional add-ons in the original mixed ticket checkout. It does **not yet decide** whether Phase 7 also permits post-purchase add-on orders or add-on-only checkout. The bounded recommendation is original-checkout selection only until a later decision explicitly owns the additional payment, cancellation, capability, and recovery lifecycle.

#### Implemented Phase 7 State — 2026-08-29

- Organizers receive a HAL-gated editor and authenticated, idempotent API/BFF
  actions to create a versioned catalog, add multiple finite items, publish a
  draft, retire a published version, and preserve historical purchased lines.
- Buyers receive a semantic, localized, RTL-safe selector in which every
  quantity starts at zero. No add-on is checked, required, bundled, or framed
  as a condition of admission.
- Checked minor-unit arithmetic snapshots each selected line. A real
  PostgreSQL test proves exactly one winner for the final item, complete loser
  rollback, partial allocation conservation, replay convergence, tenant
  isolation, and no admission-row mutation.
- The public API discloses unit price, quantity, line total, add-on total,
  grand total, fulfillment facts, refund facts, and availability without
  exposing tenant/user/participant identity or admission state. It publishes a
  neutral maximum selectable quantity so buyers are not forced into
  trial-and-error requests.
- Phase 7 creates no new platform-fee authority. It preserves the order's
  already-pinned fee while add-on value remains organizer-directed; charging a
  platform fee on add-ons requires a later explicit policy and I-VSD decision.
- A local partial-refund allocation is published only as
  `allocated_pending_provider`. It is never labeled refunded or succeeded
  before the existing payment-provider reconciliation authority confirms that
  result, and it does not release stock for resale while provider truth is
  pending.
- Provider failure reopens refundable quantity. Provider confirmation releases
  stock atomically or persists
  `provider_confirmed_inventory_release_pending` for recovery; provider truth
  is never rolled back to pending because local stock repair failed.
- The add-on allocation, canonical provider-neutral refund attempt, and
  identifiers-only dispatch outbox commit in one serializable transaction.
  Provider dispatch/reconciliation then synchronizes terminal truth back to
  the add-on allocation idempotently.
- The reserve request carries the exact catalog ID disclosed to the buyer. The
  server pins that still-published tenant/event catalog to the order and
  rejects catalog replacement instead of silently substituting later offers.
- The API and BFF expose original-checkout selection only. Post-purchase and
  add-on-only ordering, bundles, variants, scheduled fulfillment, and
  explicitly unlimited stock remain unavailable.

### IVSD-F006 — Recovery Must Restore Authority Without Resurrecting Or Duplicating Harm

- Lifecycle: accepted
- Severity / claim type: High / operational provider responsibility
- Principle and domain: amanah, accountability, prevention of harm; operations and security
- Stakeholders: all purchasers/participants, organizers, self-hosters, support and security operators
- Provider-controlled decision: backup scope/order, key custody, replay fencing, capability status, operator truth
- Evidence: implemented outbox, Quartz, Data Protection/keyed-digest, payment/refund/admission recovery patterns; predecessor validation gaps
- Validation level: repository and design evidence; real restore/operator evidence missing
- Mitigation: `IVSD-M006`
- Owner / next validation: Phases 8-9 / Tasks 8.1-9.4

### IVSD-F007 — Protected Delayed Payout Is An Escalation Gate, Not Runtime Scope

- Lifecycle: accepted
- Severity / claim type: Block / authority and evidence boundary
- Principle and domain: truthfulness, avoidance of misleading custody claims, qualified authority; finance and governance
- Stakeholders: buyers, organizers, connected-account owners, operators, complainants
- Provider-controlled decision: whether any delayed-release capability is advertised, configured, scheduled, or implemented
- Evidence: predecessor finding F9; ADR-022/024; official Stripe reserve/control documentation; missing provider/legal/scholarly/operator approvals
- Validation level: public provider and repository evidence only
- Mitigation: `IVSD-M007`
- Escalation boundary: separate future I-VSD/ADR/workstream after all named approvals and stable typed public APIs
- Owner / next validation: Phase 9 / Tasks 9.1-9.4 asserts absent/unavailable

## Recommendations

### IVSD-M001 — Version And Enforce Access/Actor/Ceiling Truth

Pin access mode, accepted terms, purchaser actor/context, and effective policy lineage. Enforce the strictest instance/tenant/event ceiling atomically and prevent context switching from multiplying entitlement.

### IVSD-M002 — Make Completion And Approval Admission Preconditions

Declare order versus participant scope, keep typed answers canonical, require subject-correct consent/approval, and withhold active credentials until all required participant facts are complete.

### IVSD-M003 — Use Atomic Future-Holder And Credential Rotation

Keep purchaser/payment/refund truth immutable; collect recipient-owned data and consent; enforce policy, expiry, and reapproval; rotate the credential in the same authoritative transition; provide no resale or money movement.

### IVSD-M004 — Use Deterministic Commercially Equivalent Reallocation

Publish stable order/tie-breakers, prioritize compatible released supply before public stock, use normal holds, and request the original-holder refund only after replacement payment is reconciled. Buyer-transparent rebinding is permitted only when tenant, event, ticket type, policy/catalog lineage, currency, accepted terms, admission entitlement, gross minor-unit amount, and refund-funding compatibility are equal. If no such supply exists, or payment handoff is possible or ambiguous, fail seller withdrawal privately and retain the binding until authoritative reconciliation. A local deadline alone never proves provider failure.

### IVSD-M005 — Bound Add-Ons To The Event Transaction

Model one tenant/event-qualified catalog with multiple independently selectable items and immutable purchased-line snapshots. Make every selection opt-in, disclose literal unit/quantity/subtotal/refund/fulfillment facts, use checked integer minor units, and prove one-winner inventory with loser rollback. Keep fulfillment and line-specific refund durable and replay-safe, use one pinned merchant/currency, conserve every allocation exactly, and ratchet add-on code away from admission, credential, participant-readiness, and ticket-capacity mutation. Do not imply post-purchase or add-on-only checkout, variants, bundles, unlimited inventory, or organizer-management completeness until those surfaces are explicitly modeled and validated.

### IVSD-M006 — Treat Keys, Fences, And Cursors As Restore-Critical State

Test restore order for application data, Data Protection/digest keys, outbox/inbox, Quartz/fences, durable business-idempotency identities, and provider cursors. Restore into stop-sale/recovery-only mode, cancel every pre-restore transfer/waitlist/recovery capability, rotate or reissue active admission credentials, reject stale workers, and fail closed on any missing authority before reopening.

### IVSD-M007 — Keep Protected Delayed Payout Absent

Do not create runtime source, configuration, migration, scheduler, API/HAL/client surface, preview/raw provider call, or escrow wording. Reopen only through a separate evidence-backed workstream.

Rejected alternatives:

- One monolithic continuation of the forms workstream: rejected because it obscures ownership, review state, and completion.
- Transfer before purchase/participant governance: rejected because recipient authority would depend on unresolved access, consent, and admission gates.
- Combined waitlist/add-on phase: rejected because scarcity/refund and optional-commerce failures have independent rollback and review boundaries.
- Feature-flagged protected payout: rejected because a flag does not create missing authority or stable provider capability.

## Stakeholders

- Purchasers acting personally or for a family, group, or organization
- Participants, minors/dependents, guardians, and independent adult recipients
- Waitlisted buyers and original ticket holders
- Organizers, fulfillment staff, door staff, support, privacy/security, and incident operators
- Tenant and instance administrators
- Independent self-hosters and the ISLAMU Project Steward
- External payment/provider, legal, accessibility, privacy/security, and qualified scholarly reviewers

## I-VSD Principles And Domains

- Justice and non-manipulation in scarce-capacity allocation
- Truthfulness in price, refund, queue, merchant, capability, and deployment claims
- Dignity, privacy, minimization, and subject-correct consent
- Prevention of fraud, hoarding, exploitation, duplicate authority, and operational harm
- Amanah and accountability through durable audit, recovery, and named ownership
- Bounded provider responsibility: event operations remain distinct from marketing, accounting, tax, invoicing, banking, and escrow

## Validation Gaps

- Stakeholder review with purchasers, participants, guardians, organizers, waitlisted users, accessibility users, staff, and self-hosters
- Privacy/security review of recipient contact, capabilities, key custody, retention/export, and restore
- Accessibility review of registration, approval, transfer, queue, status/countdown, add-on, and support-desk experiences
- Buyer and organizer validation of the multiple-item catalog, opt-in defaults, quantity controls, decline path, price/refund/fulfillment disclosure, and catalog-management workflow
- Product decision and threat-model review for original-checkout-only versus post-purchase or add-on-only ordering; later purchase paths require their own payment, capability, cancellation, idempotency, and recovery authority
- Legal/consumer review of refund/reallocation terms and supported jurisdictions
- Staffed operator ownership and service levels for queue, refund, fraud, accessibility, provider, and restore incidents
- Real backup/restore and provider deployment evidence

## Escalation Needed

- Qualified scholarly authority: finance structure, fees/contributions, reserves/control, delayed payout, and religious-legal claims
- Qualified legal/payment-services counsel: consumer rights, conditional refund, terms, and supported jurisdictions
- Provider specialist and accountable operator: exact Stripe account/controller/liability/capability evidence
- Security/privacy reviewers: capability entropy, key rotation/custody, recipient data, and restore
- Accessibility reviewers and affected users: all status, input, transfer, waitlist, and support paths

Without evidence, the affected surface remains disabled/narrowed and no certification or production-readiness claim is made.

## Missing Evidence

No production stakeholder studies, incident history, legal opinion, qualified scholarly decision, live Stripe account/control evidence, independent accessibility/privacy/security audit, or real restore exercise was available. No implemented add-on catalog, organizer-management workflow, buyer-selection surface, fulfillment mode, or post-purchase/add-on-only lifecycle exists to validate. Exact product decisions for post-purchase ordering, add-on-only checkout, variants/bundles, fulfillment modes, and explicitly unlimited inventory remain open.

## Context Inventory

- Repository planning docs, ADRs, intent/rules, implemented Phase 0–21 code/tests/contracts, and prior evidence were available.
- The finalized successor plan and tasks were revalidated against the source-free clean-room evidence and this report's stable findings.
- Context7 and official web documentation had already been reduced to source-free constraints in the predecessor clean-room handoff.
- No third-party code, snippets, schemas, SQL, tests, migrations, assets, or source-derived expressive structure is an implementation input.

## Common Overlooked Failures And Outcomes

- Actor-context switching multiplies purchase allowance and enables hoarding.
- Payment succeeds while participant requirements are incomplete, but a credential is issued anyway.
- Transfer succeeds concurrently with old-credential check-in or inherits another adult's consent.
- One released ticket is offered to both waitlist and public inventory, or refund precedes replacement payment truth.
- Seller withdrawal cancels/reprices/restarts the buyer despite substitute exact-type supply, or frees the only reserved ticket while provider payment is still ambiguous.
- The data model permits only one add-on per event, forcing unrelated optional products into one mutable record.
- An add-on is preselected, bundled into a ticket price, or required through a manipulative decline path.
- A later catalog edit rewrites a purchased line's price, currency, merchant, refund basis, or fulfillment promise.
- Concurrent buyers oversell the final add-on unit, or the loser leaves a partial order line/effect.
- Checked multiplication or aggregation overflows after inventory, persistence, or provider work has already begun.
- Partial-refund allocations do not sum exactly to the refunded add-on amount.
- Duplicate fulfillment or refund replay delivers/refunds twice.
- Add-on refund, inventory, or fulfillment mutates admission authority, participant readiness, credentials, check-in history, or ticket capacity.
- A post-purchase or add-on-only flow is introduced without its own payment, capability, cancellation, idempotency, and recovery contract.
- Restore omits keys/fences/cursors and revives authority or duplicates effects.
- A disabled payout idea leaks into configuration, HAL, generated clients, or marketing language.

- Phase 7 interpretation: one event-owned multi-item catalog; explicit zero-or-more buyer selection; immutable add-on lines; checked minor-unit totals; tenant-qualified one-winner inventory; durable replay-safe fulfillment/refund; exact refund conservation; and a hard no-admission-mutation ratchet
- Open Phase 7 product decision: original-checkout-only versus post-purchase/add-on-only ordering. Until decided, planning and implementation remain bounded to optional selection in the original mixed ticket checkout.
- Escalations required before: production claims or enabling the affected capability; protected delayed payout before any separate planning approval or implementation
- Refresh triggers: material change to access/ceiling defaults, participant/guardian consent, transfer/resale, waitlist/refund priority, add-on admission boundary, recovery/key custody, monetization/payout, provider capability, or mapped tasks/scenarios
