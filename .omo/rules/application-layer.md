# Application Layer Rules

## Applies To
- `src/Explore.Application/**/*.cs`

## Path-Specific Constraints
- **Handler Purity**: Handlers must stay single-purpose (one Command/Query per handler). No mixing of read/write concerns.
- **Contract Adherence**: Queries return DTOs shaped for the consumer; Commands return `BaseCommandResponse<TId>`.
- **Dependency Direction**: Reference Domain-only contracts and abstractions; never reach "outward" into API, Blazor, or persistence implementation details.
- **Cancellation**: Always pass `CancellationToken` through to all async calls (repository, cache, etc.).
- **Domain Rules Belong Here**: a rule that validates or normalizes command input must run in the handler, not at a transport boundary. A rule enforced only in a controller is bypassed by MCP tools and internal callers. Report the outcome as a `FailureCode` on the response; the API layer decides its HTTP shape.
- **Identity Semantics**: `Explore.Application.Authentication.PlatformIdentityPrincipalExtensions` owns the `sub -> nameidentifier -> sid -> internal_user_id` chain and provider-account reconstruction. `IUserContext` delegates to it. Add identity semantics there, never in a second place — three divergent chains previously coexisted and disagreed.
- **Record Requests And Results**: Follow the [canonical record-selection policy](../../docs/GOVERNANCE.md#canonical-record-selection-policy). Concrete handwritten MediatR requests default to sealed records; choose positional versus nominal form for construction safety. `BaseCommandResponse<T>` and its concrete result descendants are immutable records created through valid-state factories. Current `UserId`/`TenantId` never comes from a body; a legitimate target ID still requires server authorization.
- **Published Collections**: Every collection-bearing record exposes a serializer-compatible read-only/immutable shape and snapshots mutable input. Preserve JSON arrays/objects, PATCH presence, HAL extension data, and base64 bytes; do not relabel a mutable `List`, array, dictionary, or set as immutable.
