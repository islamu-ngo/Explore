## Top 5 Invariants
1. Implementation context contains only sanitized functional requirements, repository-native design material, and permitted standards or interface facts, never third-party implementation source or source-derived representations.
2. Literal copying is zero-tolerance across code, SQL, migrations, tests, comments, documentation prose, assets, and generated artifacts.
3. The implementer independently designs naming, decomposition, data relationships, control flow, UI composition, tests, and documentation, then records an AFC/SSO review.
4. No dependency may block an intended ISLAMU outbound licensing path; the CLA never grants rights over third-party material, and exceptions require documented legal/distribution approval.
5. Externally informed work retains a source register, sanitized handoff, implementation-separation attestation, dependency decision, verification evidence, and PR/journal links without retaining restricted expression.

## Top 5 Anti-Patterns
1. **Source-bearing prompt:** Supplying external code, snippets, ASTs, decompiled output, SQL, or internal structural notes contaminates the implementation context.
2. **Cosmetic rewrite:** Translating syntax or changing frameworks while preserving distinctive SSO remains non-literal copying risk.
3. **CLA laundering:** Treating a contributor signature as authority to copy or relicense third-party material invalidates provenance.
4. **Scanner-as-counsel:** Treating a passing automated license audit as proof of commercial-contract or assembled-distribution compatibility leaves material obligations unreviewed.
5. **Anonymous benchmark report:** Removing source identity rather than source expression destroys the audit trail and cannot support a clean-room handoff.

## Minimal Examples
```text
Clean-room handoff:
- Sources: titles/URLs/access dates only
- Observed behavior: inputs, outputs, errors, constraints
- Excluded: source, snippets, ASTs, internal names, copied prose/assets
- ISLAMU design: repository-native aggregate/workflow/API/HAL choices
- Attestation: implementation starts in a fresh source-free context
```

```text
Dependency decision:
- Default build: compatible version, deterministic lock
- Optional commercial build: explicit opt-in and separate rights
- Block: any terms prevent an intended ISLAMU outbound offering
```

## Verification Hooks
- `dotnet run .ci/scripts/validate-dependency-license-policy.cs -- .`
- `dotnet test --project tests/Event.Architecture.Tests/Event.Architecture.Tests.csproj --configuration Release --verbosity quiet`
- `git diff --check -- AGENTS.md docs/legal docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md .agents/skills/ip-clean-room .agents/rules/ip-clean-room.md .agents/contract/intents.yaml .agents/skills/review-pr/SKILL.md .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md dev/_journal/journal.md`
- Manual: complete [SSO And Provenance Review](resources/sso-and-provenance-review.md) and link the evidence in the PR.
