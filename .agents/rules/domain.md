# Domain Rules

## Applies To
- `src/Explore.Domain/**/*.cs`

## Path-Specific Constraints
- **Domain Purity**: Zero dependencies on Infrastructure, Persistence, or Presentation layers. No `using` statements pointing to other layers.
- **Explicit Logic**: All business rules must be explicit. Do not bury logic in auto-properties; use methods for state transitions.
- **Audit Consistency**: Ensure aggregate roots implement the expected auditing and soft-delete interfaces (e.g., `IAuditableEntity`, `ISoftDeletable`).
- **Value Semantics**: Follow the [canonical record-selection policy](../../docs/GOVERNANCE.md#canonical-record-selection-policy). Only a small, self-contained value may be a `readonly record struct`; use a sealed record class when reference-bearing value semantics fit. EF entities and outbox lifecycle entities remain classes.
- **Published Collections**: A Domain record snapshots caller-owned collections into immutable/read-only storage. Aggregate entities may keep private mutable backing collections behind read-only views; callers never mutate navigation state directly.

## Must Read
- [docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md#critical-rules](../../docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md#critical-rules) (Rules #3, #4, #5, #6, #10)
- [docs/DOMAIN.md](../../docs/DOMAIN.md)

## Verification
- Build: `dotnet build --configuration Release --verbosity quiet`
- Tests: `Event.Domain.UnitTests`, `Event.Architecture.Tests`
