/// the same name — so disposing one container shuts the shared provider down under the others. Each
/// scheduler test therefore passes its own <c>dataSourceName</c>.

/// <item><description>
/// <c>LogProvider</c> caches the first container's <see cref="ILoggerFactory"/> statically. Once that
/// container is disposed every later scheduler dies with <c>ObjectDisposedException: LoggerFactory</c>
