# Documentation Synthesis

> **Audience:** Contributors | AI agents
> **Status:** Implemented
> **Owner:** Contributor Experience
> **Last Verified:** 2026-06-12
> **Source Anchors:** `README.md`, `docs/DOCUMENTATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DOCUMENTATION_STYLE_GUIDE.md`, `docs/index.md`, `Event.Architecture.Tests/DocumentationQualityTests.cs`

## Current State

Strengths:

- Core architecture and API docs exist.
- Security and multi-tenancy behavior are now documented with implementation-level details.
- Reference docs are increasingly aligned with source code.
- Repository Markdown is the current source of truth; hosted public docs remain deferred.
- Canonical documentation metadata, source anchors, and stale-command checks now run through architecture tests.

Weaknesses:

- Some docs became too long or mixed multiple intents.
- Historical docs contained diagram-heavy sections with low signal.
- Some docs duplicated each other instead of linking.
- Operator and admin feature docs still need incremental source-grounded migration after the operator-critical runbooks.

## High-Value Direction

1. Keep repository Markdown authoritative before investing in a public docs website.
2. Keep `README.md` as the public task router and `docs/index.md` as the full inventory.
3. Keep reference docs authoritative and short.
4. Keep troubleshooting symptom-first and link to runbooks instead of duplicating long procedures.
5. Keep onboarding tutorials minimal and runnable.
6. Keep architecture docs focused on implemented patterns only.
7. Treat release documentation as part of the release contract.

## Canonical Reference Set

These docs should remain the highest-priority source of truth:

- `docs/DOCUMENTATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
- `docs/API.md`
- `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`
- `docs/SECURITY-MODEL.md`
- `docs/MULTI_TENANCY.md`
- `docs/RENDER_POLICIES.md`
- `docs/OPERATIONS.md`
- `docs/SELF_HOSTING.md`
- `docs/BACKUP_RESTORE_UPGRADE.md`
- `docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`

## Maintenance Policy

- Any behavior change should update at least one canonical reference in the same PR.
- Every PR should state docs impact: `Updated`, `Not needed`, or `Deferred` with a reason.
- Prefer links over duplicated explanations.
- Remove stale roadmap text from reference docs.
- Use source anchors for drift-prone claims about runtime, configuration, CI, tests, or deployment.
- Run the architecture documentation quality tests before merging docs-only changes.

## Near-Term Actions

1. Finish splitting `OPERATIONS.md` into reference content plus links to dedicated runbooks.
2. Keep `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` focused on repeat symptoms and exact runbook links.
3. Add admin and API cookbook docs after operator-critical docs stay green.
4. Keep `README.md` concise and aligned with canonical docs.
5. Keep `API_CHANGELOG.md` behavior-focused and short.
