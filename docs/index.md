## How To Use This Index

- Prefer the task path first, then use the full inventory below only when you need a specific reference.
- Treat how-to pages as workflows and reference pages as the exact source for keys, contracts, commands, and runtime behavior.
- If two docs disagree, prefer the page with source anchors to code, infrastructure, tests, or workflows, then fix the stale page.
