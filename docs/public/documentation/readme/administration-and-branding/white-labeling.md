# White-Labeling & Branding

White-labeling customizes the visual identity and presentation of tenant storefronts and community hubs. It does not alter platform, payment, tax, provider, or legal liability boundaries.

---

## Customizable Presentation Layers

Depending on delegated administrative scope (see [Admin Hierarchy](admin-hierarchy.md)), operators can customize:

* **Theme Tokens**: Brand primary and secondary colors, typography, and dark/light mode defaults.
* **Header & Navigation**: Logos, favicons, custom menus, and external links.
* **Footer Layouts**: Social links, copyright notices, and supplementary link groups.
* **Email Templates**: Branded headers and footers for [SMTP Outbox Delivery](../communications-and-notifications/email-smtp.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Governance Locks Retain Legal Disclosures!**  
> Instance administrators can enforce **Governance Locks** on footer components. This prevents individual tenants from hiding or deleting legally required terms of service, privacy notices, or operator identity disclosures.

## Visual Branding vs. Legal Accountability Identity

Visual branding is not legal identity:
* Public pages preserve **Operator Legal Identity** as a mandatory, non-overrideable disclosure resource (configured via `INSTANCE__OPERATORIDENTITY__*` in [Environment Variables](../configuration-and-operations/environment-variables.md#9-operator-legal-identity-production-gate)).
* If required public disclosure identity is unavailable, the footer fails closed with `503 tenant_identity_unavailable`. A brand logo or display name will never be substituted as a legal fallback.

---

## Standard Operational Workflow

1. Establish tenant ownership and bind approved domains (see [Custom Domains & SEO](custom-domains-and-seo.md)).
2. Configure required accountability identities in `.env` before customizing visual branding.
3. Apply theme, navigation, and footer settings through the [Tenant Admin Console](admin-guide.md) or import via [Configuration Manifests](../configuration-and-operations/configuration-manifests.md).
4. Verify that governance-locked disclosures remain visible and immutable.
5. Test public pages across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewport breakpoints.
