# Events & Ticketing

ISLAMU Event keeps event domain content, attendee registration, payment truth, admission issuance, and physical check-in as distinct authorities. This section explains each lifecycle and the invariants operators must preserve.

* **[Modular Event Aspects](modular-event-aspects.md)** — Relational sector models (Islamic-event details, prayer times, speakers, technology tracks) and feature module gating.
* **[Custom Properties](custom-properties.md)** — Governed custom registration questions, privacy exposure ceilings, property retirement, and GDPR data scrubbing.
* **[Ticketing & Check-In](ticketing-and-check-in.md)** — Registration vs. admission, cryptographic QR credentials, attendee recovery, and day-of-event check-in gates.

## Operating Invariant

Before publishing a paid or controlled-entry event, verify module policy, registration capacity, provider-confirmed payment/refund state, admission issuance, credential recovery, and exact-target check-in. Current server-issued [HAL links](../security-and-identity/authorization.md#the-golden-rule-of-client-ui-affordances) govern every operator affordance.
