# Authentication Providers

ISLAMU Event supports three primary authentication authorities:

- **Local Identity** - embedded ASP.NET Core Identity with platform-issued JWTs.
- **Keycloak** - an external OpenID Connect authority.
- **AT Protocol** - passwordless sign-in authorized against each user's personal data server.

Exactly one provider is primary for new sign-ins. AT Protocol can also remain an
optional login method while Local Identity or Keycloak is primary.

## Recommended Choice for Self-Hosters

1. **Local Identity is the recommended default**, especially for Docker
   Standalone. It is embedded, works on localhost and private networks, and
   needs no separate identity service. This is why the standalone image
   defaults to Local Identity.
2. **AT Protocol is the second-best choice for the average self-hoster** who
   has a public HTTPS domain. Users authorize with their AT Protocol account
   (commonly their Bluesky handle), so the host does not collect or manage
   their passwords. It is not the first default because decentralized OAuth
   callbacks require a publicly reachable HTTPS origin and therefore do not
   work on localhost-only installations.
3. **Keycloak is recommended for serious hosting teams and SaaS operators**.
   It carries the highest operational cost, but offers the most advanced
   centralized identity lifecycle, SSO/federation, multi-factor/2FA options,
   policies, and enterprise administration.

You can start with Local Identity and deliberately switch later after linking
the administrator to the target provider. The server prevents a switch that
would remove every usable administrator sign-in path.

## Supported Provider States

| Primary provider | AT Protocol login | Result |
|---|---:|---|
| `local` | `false` | Local Identity only |
| `local` | `true` | Local Identity plus AT Protocol |
| `keycloak` | `false` | Keycloak only |
| `keycloak` | `true` | Keycloak plus AT Protocol |
| `atproto` | `true` | AT Protocol only |

`AUTHENTICATION_PROVIDER=atproto` requires
`ATPROTO_LOGIN_ENABLED=true`. The application rejects the contradictory
`false` combination. Google SSO is disabled in AT Protocol-only mode.

## Passwordless AT Protocol Onboarding

1. Start first-run setup and choose **AT Protocol** as the primary provider.
2. Configure the public instance URL used by AT Protocol OAuth metadata.
3. Save the provider configuration.
4. Enter the administrator's AT Protocol handle on the focused sign-in page.
5. Authorize the request at the account's personal data server.
6. Return to the setup wizard and complete instance onboarding.

No local password, Local Identity account, or Keycloak realm is created. The
OAuth return creates one passwordless platform account for the verified DID.
Administrator authority is granted only while the original setup-secret
session completes onboarding; OAuth success by itself cannot claim the
instance.

The instance still needs its server-only AT Protocol confidential-client ES256
key ring. Store that key ring through the selected secret authority. It signs
OAuth client assertions; it is not a user password and is never sent to the
browser.

## Runtime Behavior

The browser receives an encrypted HttpOnly BFF cookie. Provider access tokens,
OAuth session material, and platform bearer tokens remain server-side.

In AT Protocol-only mode:

- `/auth/providers` advertises only the ready AT Protocol handle flow;
- the login page opens the handle field immediately;
- Local Identity login and registration fail closed;
- unlinked verified DIDs are provisioned without a local password;
- repeated or concurrent first login converges on one account.

Existing sessions continue under the provider that issued them until normal
expiry. Changing the primary provider controls new sign-in admission; it does
not reinterpret an existing cookie as a different authority.

## Switching Providers Safely

Use **Administration -> Instance Settings -> Authentication and Authorization
Providers**. The selector offers Local Identity, Keycloak, and AT Protocol.

Before switching:

- confirm the current administrator already has an exact account binding for
  the target provider;
- keep the target provider healthy and reachable;
- do not disable the only provider linked to the current administrator;
- keep AT Protocol enabled while it is primary.

The server performs the authoritative self-lockout check. The confirmation
dialog is guidance, not authorization.

## Break-Glass Recovery

If every interactive administrator path is lost but the target DID is already
linked, follow
[Lost Instance Administrator Access](troubleshooting-and-health.md#recipe-7-lost-instance-administrator-access).
The recovery tool does not create accounts, resolve handles, change onboarding
state, or grant tenant authority.
