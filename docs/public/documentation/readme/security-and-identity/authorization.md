# Authorization & Access Control

Authorization in ISLAMU Event determines *what* an authenticated identity is permitted to do. The platform provides a runtime choice between **Local Database-Backed RBAC** and an external **Cerbos Policy Decision Point (PDP)**.

---

## Authorization Pipeline Flow

Every mutation and sensitive query passes through a multi-stage, fail-closed authorization pipeline before reaching business logic:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Incoming HTTP Request] --> B{Endpoint Policy Check}
    B -- Denied --> X[401 Unauthorized / 403 Forbidden]
    B -- Allowed --> C[MediatR Request Pipeline]
    C --> D{Authorization Provider<br>Local RBAC vs. Cerbos}
    D -- Denied / Unreachable --> X
    D -- Allowed --> E[Handler Executes Domain Logic]
    E --> F[Resource Assembler Computes HAL Links]
    F --> G[Client Receives Resource + Affordance Links]
```

1. **Endpoint Boundary**: Broad policy checks verify caller identity and minimum claims.
2. **MediatR Pipeline**: The request evaluates the caller, tenant context, resource state, and requested action against policy rules.
3. **Execution Gate**: Handlers only execute if authorization explicitly returns `Allow`.
4. **HATEOAS Affordance Gating**: The response dynamically attaches allowed actions in HAL `_links` (e.g., `_links.edit`, `_links.refund`). The client renders UI buttons strictly based on the presence of these links.

## Choosing Your Authorization Provider

| Decision Factor | Local RBAC (`AUTHORIZATION_PROVIDER=local`) | Cerbos PDP (`AUTHORIZATION_PROVIDER=cerbos`) |
|---|---|---|
| **Ideal For** | Single-tenant communities, standard organizations, minimal resource footprint | Enterprise operators, dynamic policy authoring, audit-heavy deployments |
| **Infrastructure** | **Zero extra containers**; runs in-process using primary database | Dedicated Cerbos container or external PDP cluster over gRPC |
| **Latency** | Sub-millisecond (in-memory & direct database query) | 1–3 ms network round-trip via HTTP/2 cleartext (`h2c`) |
| **Policy Updates** | Governed via software releases and database migrations | Decoupled policy file uploads via `cerbosctl` without rebuilding the app |
| **Failure Mode** | Database down = app down | PDP down = **fails closed** (access strictly denied; no silent fallback) |

> [!TIP]
> **Our Recommendation:**
> - **We recommend Local RBAC** for the vast majority of self-hosters. It has zero external dependencies, minimal RAM overhead, and satisfies standard community and multi-tenant security boundaries out of the box.
> - **We recommend Cerbos** if you have dedicated security teams who write and version YAML policies independently of application code, or need centralized authorization across multiple external systems.

## Local RBAC Overview

When `AUTHORIZATION_PROVIDER=local` is set:
- Evaluates permissions against user roles (`InstanceAdmin`, `TenantAdmin`, `OrganizationOwner`, `Member`, `Attendee`).
- Automatically enforces multi-tenant boundaries via EF Core global query filters.
- Fast, lightweight, and requires no external network calls or gRPC configuration.

---

## Cerbos PDP Overview

When `AUTHORIZATION_PROVIDER=cerbos` is set:
- Evaluates policies via high-performance gRPC requests to Cerbos port `3593`.
- Requires Cerbos policies and schemas to be uploaded via `cerbosctl` (see [Coolify with Cerbos & Traefik](../self-hosting/coolify-cerbos-traefik.md)).
- **Fail-Closed Guarantee**: If Cerbos becomes unreachable or returns an error, ISLAMU Event denies access immediately. It will **never** silently fall back to local RBAC, preventing accidental security elevation during infrastructure outages.

## The Golden Rule of Client UI Affordances

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Never Check Roles in Frontend Code!**  
> Clients (Blazor WebAssembly or third-party mobile apps) must never inspect user roles or JWT claims to decide whether to show an "Edit", "Delete", or "Refund" button.
> 
> The UI checks **only** if the action link exists in the server's response:
> ```csharp
> @if (Model.Links.ContainsKey("edit"))
> {
>     <MudButton Href="@Model.Links["edit"].Href">Edit Event</MudButton>
> }
> ```
> If an event is locked, past due, or the user lacks permission, the server omits the link and the button disappears automatically.
