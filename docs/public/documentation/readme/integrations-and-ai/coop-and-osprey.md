# Coop & Osprey Moderation Integrations

ISLAMU Event integrates with **Coop** (distributed review queue) and **Osprey** (AI-assisted signal evaluation coordinator) to support community moderation workflows. Neither external system ever replaces local tenant policy, human administrative authority, or auditable database state.

---

## 1. Coop Review Queue Mirroring

* **Architecture**: When an attendee reports an event or user profile, the platform generates a metadata-first moderation ticket. If the `moderation` profile is enabled (see [Docker Compose Profiles](../self-hosting/docker-compose.md#optional-service-profiles)), the ticket is mirrored to Coop via authenticated HMAC envelopes (see [Webhooks](webhooks.md)).
* **Local Decision Finality**: Moderators can review tickets in Coop, but the ultimate execution of decisions (suspending an event, issuing warnings, or banning users) commits exclusively within ISLAMU Event via signed callback verification.

---

## 2. Osprey Advisory AI Signals

Osprey acts strictly as an **advisory, signal-only evaluation coordinator**:
* Analyzes event text for policy violations and assigns priority scores to assist human moderators.
* **Hard Limitations**: Osprey cannot execute enforcement decisions, cannot close moderation tickets, cannot dispatch attendee notifications, and cannot override [Authorization Policies](../security-and-identity/authorization.md).
* Model outputs are never presented as religious rulings, ethical certifications, or automated bans.

## 3. Configuration & Startup Flags

Configured via environment variables (see [Environment Variables Reference](../configuration-and-operations/environment-variables.md#external-moderation-coop--osprey)):
* `REPORTING_MODE`: `LocalOnly` (default), `Coop`, `Osprey`, or `Composite`.
* `REPORTING_COOP_ENDPOINT_URL`, `REPORTING_COOP_API_KEY`.
* `REPORTING_OSPREY_ENDPOINT_URL`, `REPORTING_OSPREY_API_KEY`.
