# HAL/REST Contract

## Media types and minimal responses

Request HAL explicitly when you need navigable affordances:

```http
Accept: application/hal+json;v=0.1
```

Use `Prefer: return=minimal` when a machine client does not need generated links. This reduces representation size but also removes the client's action authority; do not use it for a UI that must decide which mutations to show.

## Hypermedia is the action contract

A resource or collection may expose relations such as `self`, `edit`, `delete`, `check-in`, `undo-check-in`, `request-refund`, `create-refund`, or administration actions. Follow the link currently returned for the current caller, tenant, resource state, and policy.

Do not construct mutation URLs from naming conventions or enable controls from local roles/claims. A link may disappear after state, tenant, policy, concurrency, or provider changes. Refresh the representation after a mutation or authorization-relevant event.

## Pagination

List operations use 1-based pages:

```http
GET /api/events?page=1&pageSize=20
```

Default page size is `20`; maximum is `100`. Preserve server-provided navigation links rather than calculating routes that may not carry all query/version context.

## Writes, concurrency, and idempotency

Use the HTTP method and target from HAL. Where the endpoint documents replay protection, generate one UUIDv7 per logical operation and reuse it only for retries of that same operation:

```http
Idempotency-Key: 0198f4a6-7b8c-7def-8123-456789abcdef
```

The platform scopes retained write replays by tenant and key for a bounded window. A new business action needs a new key. Idempotency does not replace optimistic concurrency, resource-version checks, provider reconciliation, or domain validation.

## ProblemDetails

Failed commands never return a success-shaped command body. Errors use `application/problem+json` and may include:

```json
{
  "type": "https://errors.islamu.example/problem-code",
  "title": "Request could not be completed",
  "status": 409,
  "detail": "A bounded public explanation.",
  "traceId": "...",
  "correlationId": "...",
  "timestamp": "..."
}
```

Treat `type`/problem code and HTTP status as the stable machine-facing signal. Production responses hide internal parser paths and unhandled exception detail. Authentication, authorization, not-found, concurrency, validation, and quota failures are normalized by shared handling.

## Privacy and caching

Private account, commerce, refund, and erasure responses are `no-store`. Never persist provider IDs, admission bearer material, idempotency material, erasure receipts, raw provider errors, or PII from diagnostic responses. Health and metrics are operational surfaces, not data-export APIs.
