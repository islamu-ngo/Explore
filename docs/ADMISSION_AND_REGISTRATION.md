## 1. Executive Summary & Conceptual Distinction

In the ISLAMU Event platform, **Registration** and **Admission** represent two fundamentally distinct bounded contexts and lifecycles:

* **Registration** is the **commercial, administrative, and data-collection transaction** between a purchaser and the organizer (*"Who ordered what, which questions were answered, and is the payment reconciled?"*).
* **Admission** is the **access entitlement, cryptographic credentialing, and gate-entry authority** (*"Does this specific human have a valid, unrevoked, authentic credential to enter this session right now?"*).

## 2. Architectural Separation Rationale

Registration and Admission are kept in separate aggregates for five critical architectural reasons:

1. **Entitlement Expansion (1-to-Many Mappings):**
   A purchaser buys one ticket type (e.g., *"3-Day Conference All-Access Pass"*). That single order line entitles the attendee to multiple days, tracks, and individual sessions. The registration domain records the $1$ purchase, while the admission domain expands this into $M$ granular session-level [`EventRegistration`](../src/Explore.Domain/EventRegistration.cs) admission slots.
2. **Purchaser vs. Attendee Independence:**
   A purchaser (e.g., a corporate buyer or family member) often buys tickets for other individuals. The order belongs to the purchaser, but each assigned [`RegistrationParticipant`](../src/Explore.Domain/RegistrationParticipant.cs) receives their own independently managed [`AdmissionTicket`](../src/Explore.Domain/AdmissionTicket.cs) and cryptographic QR credential.
3. **Zero-Knowledge Security & PII Isolation:**
   Registration orders store sensitive PII, custom questionnaire answers, and payment provider tokens. Conversely, the admission credential aggregate stores **only versioned keyed HMAC-SHA-256 lookup digests**, never plaintext barcodes, tokens, or PII. The HMAC key remains outside the database in the secret provider, so a database read replica or backup does not contain usable admission credentials or barcodes.
4. **Independent Lifecycle & Revocation:**
   If a ticket is lost, stolen, or reassigned, the admission credential can be rotated or revoked (`AdmissionTicketStatusEnum.Revoked`) without rewriting the immutable financial or tax history of the original [`RegistrationOrder`](../src/Explore.Domain/RegistrationOrder.cs).
5. **High-Throughput Online Gate Checking:**
   Gate check-in accepts camera, HID, and manual input only through server-authoritative online validation. It resolves the high-entropy bearer digest without loading heavy order history, pricing rules, payment attempts, or custom form answers; there is no offline validation fallback or retained offline admission queue.

## 3. Core Aggregates & Domain Entities

### Registration Domain Models

* **[`RegistrationOrder`](../src/Explore.Domain/RegistrationOrder.cs)**: The aggregate root managing the booking workflow, purchaser actor/account, order lines, financial sums, currency, inventory reservations, and payment state.
  * *Statuses (`RegistrationOrderStatusEnum`)*: `Draft` $\to$ `PendingPayment` $\to$ `Confirmed`, `Cancelled`, `Expired`, `Refunded`.
* **[`RegistrationOrderLine`](../src/Explore.Domain/RegistrationOrderLine.cs)**: Represents quantity, pricing snapshot, and target [`EventTicketType`](../src/Explore.Domain/EventTicketType.cs).
* **[`RegistrationParticipant`](../src/Explore.Domain/RegistrationParticipant.cs)**: Attendee identity facts (name, email, optional linked user ID) and questionnaire responses.
* **[`RegistrationTicketAssignment`](../src/Explore.Domain/RegistrationTicketAssignment.cs)**: Binds a single unit of an order line to a specific participant.

### Admission Domain Models

* **[`AdmissionTicket`](../src/Explore.Domain/AdmissionTicket.cs)**: The aggregate root for physical/digital gate admission. Issued automatically only after confirmed free authority or exact reconciled paid-finalization authority.
  * *Statuses (`AdmissionTicketStatusEnum`)*: `Active`, `Suspended`, `Revoked`, `Cancelled`, `Transferred`, `Expired`.
  * *Transition reasons include*: `Issued`, `Reissued`, `Transferred`, `FullyRefunded`, `OrderCancelled`, `ManualRevocation`, and `Compromised`.
* **[`AdmissionTicketCredential`](../src/Explore.Domain/AdmissionTicketCredential.cs)**: Child entity owning the versioned cryptographic lookup digest (`LookupDigest`) and key version (`LookupKeyVersion`).
* **[`EventRegistration`](../src/Explore.Domain/EventRegistration.cs)**: The concrete per-session admission slot linking an attendee to a specific [`EventSession`](../src/Explore.Domain/EventSession.cs), used for session-level capacity tracking and roster management.
* **[`AdmissionRecoveryCapability`](../src/Explore.Domain/AdmissionRecoveryCapability.cs)**: Durable keyed-digest state for an expiring, single-use, rate-limited guest recovery capability; plaintext is never persisted.

## 4. Key Application & Infrastructure Services

### 1. Entitlement Materialization
* **[`RegistrationAdmissionMaterializer`](../src/Explore.Application/Services/Registration/RegistrationAdmissionMaterializer.cs)**:
  * Evaluates [`TicketTypeEntitlement`](../src/Explore.Domain/TicketTypeEntitlement.cs) scopes (`Event`, `EventDay`, `EventSession`).
  * Expands each purchased ticket into individual session admission instances (`EventRegistration`) for the assigned participant.

### 2. Credential Generation & Zero-Knowledge Storage
* **[`AdmissionIssuanceService`](../src/Explore.Application/Services/Registration/AdmissionIssuanceService.cs)**:
  * Executes under a database transaction fence during order finalization.
  * Generates random 32-byte cryptographic bearers.
  * Invokes [`IAdmissionCredentialDigestService`](../src/Explore.Infrastructure/Services/Registration/AdmissionCredentialDigestService.cs) to compute HMAC-SHA-256 lookup digests.
  * Stages encrypted delivery outbox messages before committing.

### 3. QR Wire Codec & Payload Standard
* **[`AdmissionQrPayloadCodec`](../src/Event.Wire.Contracts/Admissions/AdmissionQrPayloadCodec.cs)**:
  * Formats admission QR codes with the canonical prefix:
    $$\text{islamu-admission:v1:}\langle\text{43-character Base64url bearer}\rangle$$
  * Total payload length is exactly 63 characters.
  * Strictly redacts plaintext credentials from debugging strings, logs, and OpenTelemetry spans.

### 4. Self-Service Ticket Recovery (Lost Tickets)
* **[`AdmissionTicketRecoveryController`](../src/Explore.API/Controllers/AdmissionTicketRecoveryController.cs)** & **[`AdmissionRecoveryService`](../src/Explore.Application/Services/Registration/AdmissionRecoveryService.cs)**:
  * `POST /api/tickets/recovery`: Accepts an attendee email address. Returns an indistinguishable `202 Accepted` response regardless of whether the email exists. It is a `PublicTransactional` write protected by the exact `public_transactional` per-IP policy, idempotency middleware, and a chained tenant recovery budget.
  * Sends a single-use magic recovery link with an encrypted capability token.
  * `POST /api/tickets/recovery/consume`: Consumes the capability via `X-Admission-Ticket-Recovery-Capability`, rotates it atomically, and returns QR and print delivery documents. It uses the dedicated admission-recovery limiter and deliberately does not use idempotency replay because a successful bearer response must remain single-use.

### 4.4 Paid Confirmation, Refund, And Cancellation Authority

* The finalization drain invokes `IAdmissionIssuanceService` only after the registration lifecycle
  reports `Confirmed`. A paid order uses `ReconciledPaidFinalization`; Persistence independently
  verifies one exact `PaymentSucceededObservation`, its succeeded `PaymentAttempt`, currency, and
  snapshotted minor-unit composition. `NotConfirmed` never completes the durable finalization effect.
* `AdmissionRefundRevocationService` consumes only persisted provider-neutral `RefundAttempt`,
  `RefundLineAllocation`, and `PaidOrderAcceptanceSnapshot` entities. It sums cumulative
  buyer-success organizer allocations per accepted order line. Only a fully refunded line matching
  an issued ticket assignment revokes that ticket; partial and add-on-only allocations preserve it.
* Registration-order cancellation is consumed from the order lifecycle outbox. Event cancellation
  stages a separate identifier-only outbox message in the same unit of work; each worker invocation
  handles at most 100 active admission orders and persists a continuation when the batch is full.
  Each order transition and current-credential revocation is independently transactional and
  idempotent, so outbox replay converges after partial progress.
* Paid issuance locks both the registration-order row and its event authority row. Event cancellation
  therefore either commits first and makes issuance fail closed, or waits for issuance to commit and
  then lets the durable cancellation outbox revoke the newly issued credential.
* Payment/refund provider SDK objects, raw webhook payloads, buyer PII, and bearer credentials never
  enter admission revocation facts or outbox payloads.
* Email handoff is deliberately at-least-once: SMTP acceptance and the local handoff receipt cannot
  be committed atomically. Replay uses the same stable intent/idempotency identity and never mints a
  second credential; recovery capabilities remain single-use. Email adapters should deduplicate the
  stable identity where their provider supports it.

## 6. Phase 21 Online Check-In Model

### Authority And Data Flow

| Stage | Server-authoritative input | Persisted result | Operator-visible result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Capability issuance | Authenticated organizer authority and one exact `AdmissionTarget` | A tenant/event/target/action/expiry-scoped scanner capability with a keyed digest only | Plaintext is disclosed to the issuer once; later reads are masked. |
| Check-in | Staff identity or the dedicated scanner capability, opaque QR/manual value, and entitlement-target state | One append-only `AdmissionCheckInEvent` and atomically updated target state | `admitted`, idempotent already-admitted, or generic rejection. |
| Undo | Authorized action, exact active check-in fact, and closed reason code | A compensating append-only undo fact linked to that check-in; no prior fact is deleted | Corrected admission state with preserved history and no operator prose. |
| Revocation or expiry | Server-side capability and credential lifecycle facts | Scope or credential becomes unusable immediately | Generic rejection; detailed fixed reason remains internal. |

`AdmissionTarget` also owns a durable `Active`/`Stopped` operational status. Authorized stop and
restore commands update that state under the target concurrency token and append a bounded
PII-free operator audit fact in the same transaction. Check-in rules and scanner-capability
issuance both consult the state, so a stopped target fails closed without deleting credentials or
historical facts. Reconcile appends a reason-coded operator decision without mutating the
append-only check-in stream.

Undo accepts only `OperatorCorrection`, `DuplicateScan`, `WrongTarget`, or
`ExceptionalReconciliation`. The enum identity is persisted; free-form operator text is not part
of the check-in contract or append-only fact.

Successful check-in results expose the persisted UUIDv7 fact identity. The advertised
`undo-admission-check-in` relation is tied to that exact active fact; an arbitrary, historical, or
cross-target identifier cannot undo current state. Authorized detail reads return only the fact
identity, bounded outcome, target, timestamp, and currently valid undo affordance.

An `AdmissionScannerCapability` has **one exact `AdmissionTarget`**. A door or target needs a separate capability; a bearer must not select a target from request input or span multiple targets. Staff writes use the normal authenticated staff path, while scanner writes use the dedicated scanner path. The authorities, routes, and audit identities stay separate.

### Credential And Audit Boundaries

- Capability issuance has one UUIDv7 issue request. Exactly one concurrent winner receives plaintext; persistence and every later list, read, and revoke response retain only a masked representation or no secret at all.
- A check-in fact is not a mutable `IsCheckedIn` flag. Current state is the concurrency projection of append-only check-in and undo facts.
- Public wrong-scope, malformed, expired, revoked, and otherwise invalid authority receives the same generic failure. Internal audit keeps only a bounded fixed reason code needed for reconciliation; it does not retain plaintext credentials, attendee data, raw scanner input, or device fingerprints.
- The exact-target check-in summary requires `targetId` and reports only target type, `long` CheckedIn/Undone and Active/Inactive counts, and an hourly last-activity bucket. Rejected attempts are not persisted facts and are not reported as a count.
- The event audit read uses an opaque keyset cursor over immutable `OccurredAtUtc` and UUIDv7 fact identity, ordered by both values descending. Pages contain no more than 100 rows and export only the opaque cursor, action, outcome, target type, hourly time bucket, and next cursor. New check-ins cannot shift an in-progress traversal, and no fact identifier is exposed as an API field. It is not a roster, ticket lookup, actor/device report, or cross-event enumeration surface.
- Both reporting reads require `EventCheckInView`, are private/no-store and authenticated-rate-limited, and return generic absence when their authorized lineage is unavailable.
- `check-in-admissions` is the HAL entry relation. Clients render check-in, undo, issuance, revocation, stop, restore, and reconciliation controls only when the relevant HAL relation is present.

### Online-Only Operational Boundary

Connectivity loss is a denial of admission validation, not permission to validate locally. The scanner must show a bounded outage state, retain no offline validation or submission queue, and resume only after the service is available. Emergency exception admission is **not implemented**: any future design must be a separate authenticated, reasoned, append-only operator action with later reconciliation; it must not be inferred from a scanner outage.

See [Operations](OPERATIONS.md#admission-check-in-operations-phase-21) for incident response, export-safe audit, alerts, and rollback evidence.
