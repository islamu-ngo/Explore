# AT Protocol Lexicons

> **Audience:** Contributors | Integrators | AI agents
> **Status:** Implemented
> **Owner:** Federation
> **Last Verified:** 2026-07-19
> **Source Anchors:** `schemas/lexicons/`, `src/Explore.Infrastructure/Explore.Infrastructure.csproj`, `src/Explore.Infrastructure/Services/Federation/`, `src/Explore.Application/Features/Federation/Atproto/`

## Purpose

The JSON files under `schemas/lexicons/` are the executable AT Protocol vocabulary. `Explore.Infrastructure.csproj` includes them as `LexiconFiles`, and the pinned CarpaNet source generator produces the typed JSON and DAG-CBOR bindings used by outbound mapping and Jetstream parsing. Runtime lexicon discovery and network auto-resolution are not enabled.

Unvendored proposal namespaces are not accepted federation collections. Only the checked-in lexicons below are executable.

## Executable Boundary

| NSID | Runtime use |
|---|---|
| `community.lexicon.calendar.event` | The only event collection accepted from Jetstream or emitted to an owner's PDS. |
| `community.lexicon.calendar.rsvp` | The only RSVP collection accepted from Jetstream. Outbound ISLAMU RSVP is stricter and emits only `#going`. |
| `com.atproto.repo.strongRef` | RSVP subject with required settled event `at://` URI and CID. |
| `community.lexicon.location.address` | Typed address member allowed by the event `locations` union after public-disclosure evaluation. |
| `community.lexicon.location.geo` | Typed geographic point allowed only after public-disclosure evaluation. |
| `community.lexicon.location.fsq` | Typed Foursquare location reference accepted by the event union. |
| `community.lexicon.location.hthree` | Typed H3 location reference accepted by the event union. |
| `com.atproto.server.getSession` | OAuth/session verification binding; not a federation record collection. |

The global Jetstream subscriber requests exactly the event and RSVP collections. Unknown/wildcard collections are never subscribed, and the parser quarantines an admitted envelope whose collection, `$type`, operation, DID, CID, record key, shape, or encoded size is invalid.

## Community Event Record

The vendored event lexicon requires `name` and `createdAt`. It also defines optional `description`, `startsAt`, `endsAt`, `mode`, `status`, `locations`, `uris`, and `rsvpExpected` fields. Known mode tokens are `#inperson`, `#virtual`, and `#hybrid`; known status tokens are `#planned`, `#scheduled`, `#rescheduled`, `#cancelled`, and `#postponed`.

ISLAMU uses one record for the complete public event graph:

- Native lexicon values are mapped by `AtprotoCalendarEventRecordMapper`.
- `AtprotoEventSourceFieldManifest` independently classifies every public source value as native, rendered in the single `description`, or excluded for a precise privacy/internal reason.
- `AtprotoEventDescriptionFormatter` deterministically renders all remaining eligible event, session, agenda, group, speaker, aspect, resolved-lookup, public-media, and public EAV values into that one description.
- Raw locations and location PII are never sources. Only the public disclosure evaluator's returned values may enter native location fields or the description.
- Any uncovered field, invalid projection, unsafe URI, privacy failure, invalid lexicon value, JSON size above 2,097,152 bytes, or DAG-CBOR size above 1,048,576 bytes prevents enqueue. No value is truncated or silently dropped.

`federation.atproto_event_validation_profile=community_lexicon` relaxes only which local business fields must be present to publish: title, tenant, owner, and status remain required. It does not relax validation of supplied values, authorization, moderation, privacy, complete source-field disposition, or final record validation.

## Community RSVP Record

The vendored RSVP lexicon requires `subject` and `status`. Its `strongRef` subject requires an event URI and CID; its vocabulary recognizes `#interested`, `#going`, and `#notgoing` for inbound interoperability.

The local outbound contract is intentionally narrower:

- Only a successfully committed, active `EventRegistrationIntent` maps to `community.lexicon.calendar.rsvp#going`.
- Organizer `ApprovalStatus` never changes that user-intent mapping.
- `#interested` and `#notgoing` have no local user-intent model and are rejected for outbound publication.
- RSVP enqueue waits for the locally owned event record to settle its exact URI/CID. The outbox stores both the event-record dependency and captured CID before a worker can claim it.
- Final cancellation deletes a known remote RSVP only when no active registration intent remains.
- Attendee profile/PII, registration answers, payment, moderation, audit, approval state, and local IDs never enter the RSVP payload.

## Ownership And Persistence

Lexicons define wire shapes, not mutation authority. Local event and registration lifecycle handlers are the only outbound authority and write immutable `PdsSyncOutbox` intents inside the local transaction. CarpaNet PDS I/O happens only after commit and under a renewable fenced worker claim.

Inbound records are globally canonical by DID, collection, and record key with one current source version. Canonical materialization, typed event projection, tenant presentation, tombstone/quarantine effects, and cursor advancement are atomic under the one leased consumer. Tenant discovery remains separately gated by the effective `federation.atproto_events_enabled` capability.

## Evolution Rules

1. Change a record shape only by updating its vendored JSON and the typed mapper/parser/validator tests in the same workstream.
2. Keep `LexiconFiles` explicit and hermetic; do not add runtime resolution or wildcard imports.
3. Treat constraint tightening, required-field additions, token removal, or field removal as compatibility-impacting changes that need an upstream/versioning decision before adoption.
4. An internal EAV field does not create a new AT Protocol schema. Eligible public EAV values continue through the exhaustive description contract until an approved vendored lexicon field exists.
5. Adding a third ingress collection requires an explicit product/architecture decision plus subscriber, parser, persistence, privacy, HAL, and recovery coverage. Do not widen `WantedCollections` speculatively.
