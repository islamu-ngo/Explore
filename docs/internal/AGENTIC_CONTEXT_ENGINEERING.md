## 1. Executive Overview & Design Philosophy

The **ISLAMU Event Agentic Context Engineering System** provides a deterministic, token-efficient, and multi-harness governance framework for autonomous and human-in-the-loop AI software engineering.

In modern agentic development, AI agents fail not from a lack of programming syntax knowledge, but from **context drift, assumption hallucination, test tautology ("The Ugly Mirror"), token budget exhaustion, and execution sprawl**. 

This system enforces five core design tenets:

1. **Smallest Decision-Complete Working Set**: Context is retrieved once, summarized once, and reused via an in-session context ledger (`path + symbol + revision`). Agents never reread unchanged files or inject entire registries.
2. **Zero-Turn Structural Injection**: When graph tooling is available, pre-flight blast-radius slices reduce manual traversal by injecting callers, callees, impacted flows, and tests on Turn 1.
3. **Behavior-Bound Test-First Invariants**: Requirements are written as observable system behavior (RFC 2119 + `WHEN`/`THEN` Scenarios) and mapped directly to failing Red tests at pre-agreed public seams *before* production code is touched.
4. **Portable Root Contract With A Scoped Twin Pair**: `AGENTS.md` is the portable authority. Reciprocal path-rule twins currently cover only `.agents/rules` and `.omo/rules`; Claude, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini, and other harness adapters remain separate drift-prone integration surfaces.
5. **Phase-Atomic Declarative Git Delivery**: Execution runs on dedicated task branches (`feat/<task-name>`). Planning pre-authors declarative Conventional Commit contracts in `tasks.md`. Phases close atomically by staging owned paths and committing directly via Git without recording commit hashes in markdown (the Git commit log is the single source of truth).

## 2. The Three-Tier Architecture: Orchestration, Phase Closure, And Domain Guardrails

The repository's agentic system divides its 40+ skills into three distinct tiers:

1. **User-Invoked Orchestration Tier (Human-in-the-Loop Governance & Execution)**: High-level governance, ethical design, planning, critique, and autonomous execution skills that the developer explicitly invokes. During execution, the developer combines the `/goal` harness command with the `implement-tasks` skill, instructing the agent to utilize Tavily MCP for external research, Context7 MCP for framework documentation, and Code-Review-Graph MCP for structural discovery, upholding Clean Architecture, enterprise-grade engineering, and pre-release greenfield breaking-change freedom (zero backward compatibility baggage).
2. **Plan-Authoring Phase Closure Tier (Commit Contract Dependency & Standalone Human Tool)**: The `conventional-commit` skill is a dependency of `implementation-plan` and `senior-cto-feedback`, used during planning and review to pre-author and validate declarative commit contracts in `tasks.md`. The active execution loop does NOT load `conventional-commit` (saving context tokens); it directly executes the pre-authored contract. Human developers also invoke `conventional-commit` standalone when making changes directly or for ad-hoc commits.
3. **Indirectly-Invoked Domain Execution Tier (Autonomous Machine Guardrails)**: Technical domain patterns, Clean Architecture rules, and tool wrappers that the AI activates autonomously in the background based on edited file paths, matched intents, and domain patterns.

### The Canonical 5-Stage Human-in-the-Loop Lifecycle

This is the standard, end-to-end path for implementing substantial features and architectural changes:

```

### Skill Tier Taxonomy

| Tier | Invocation Model | Key Skills | Role & Primary Responsibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Orchestration Tier** | **User-Invoked** (Direct developer prompt or slash command) | `i-vsd`, `implementation-plan`, `senior-cto-feedback`, `implement-tasks`, `/goal`, `/grill-me`, `robin-neutral` | Sets ethical boundaries, interrogates requirements, authors workstream plans (`dev/active/<task>/`), audits architecture, and executes phases autonomously to completion via `/goal`. |
| **Phase Closure Tier** | **Planning/Review-Invoked Dependency; Standalone Human Tool** | `conventional-commit` | Dependency of `implementation-plan` and `senior-cto-feedback` for authoring declarative commit contracts in `tasks.md`. Execution does not load this skill. Also used standalone by humans for manual or ad-hoc commits. |
| **Domain Execution Tier** | **Indirectly-Invoked** (Autonomously activated via matched intent, rule path, or graph trigger) | `clean-architecture-rules`, `cqrs-mediatr-guidelines`, `dotnet-efcore-guidelines`, `blazor-ui-conventions`, `auth-patterns`, `outbox-pattern`, `debug-issue`, `refactor-safely`, `review-changes`, `review-pr`, `accessibility` | Enforces layer boundaries, immutable record contracts, zero-internal-mocking, fail-closed auth, transactional outbox dispatch, and two-axis review during active coding. |

## 3. Zero-Knowledge Cold-Start & Classification Lifecycle

When an AI agent starts work in this repository, it follows a deterministic cold-start sequence.

### Criticality Tier Matrix

| Criticality Tier | Target Domain & Scope | Intake & Inquiry Protocol | Exploration Budget | Test & Verification Strategy | Multi-Agent Review Protocol |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Tier 0: Sovereign** | Money, payments, checkout, RSVPs, capacity holds, refund authority | Mandatory `/grill-me` on concurrency, hold expiration, rollback | Exhaustive Knowledge Graph (callers, callees, outbox, DB locks, ADRs) | Invariant-Breaker concurrency tests + real PostgreSQL evidence | Anonymized Epistemic MAD (Weighted Voting) |
| **Tier 1: Security** | Auth, Cerbos policies, tenant boundaries, migrations, tokens | Mandatory `/grill-me` on threat models, fail-closed auth, tenant spoofing | Exhaustive Graph + Policy filters + Global query filters | Invariant-Breakers + multi-provider DB and fail-closed authorization tests | Anonymized Epistemic MAD (Weighted Voting) |
| **Tier 2: Privacy** | PII fields, erasure, AI context gateway, export, audit redaction | Mandatory `/grill-me` on erasure authority, anti-resurrection, receipt tokens | Exhaustive Data Flow tracing (`*Pii`, log sinks, vector DBs) | Invariant-Breakers + log sink PII scans + purge verification | Anonymized Epistemic MAD (Weighted Voting) |
| **Tier 3: Domain State** | Aggregate root domain logic, MediatR command/query handlers | Standard Q&A (only if requirements are ambiguous) | Bounded caller/callee tracing of target aggregate/handler | Behavioral CQRS unit and integration tests | Peer Review (`backend-engineer-agent`) |
| **Tier 4: Standard UI / Docs** | Blazor client components, CSS isolation, Markdown docs, agent context | Autonomous defaults (zero unnecessary interruptions) | Local surface reading (target razor/css/doc file only) | Affordance & component render tests; Markdown schema checks | Lightweight Self-Check (`presentation-engineer-agent`) |

## 4. Multi-Harness Bootloaders And Actual Twin Scope

The portable authority is root `AGENTS.md` plus the intent/skill/rule system. Harness adapters are currently heterogeneous; only `.agents/rules` and `.omo/rules` are maintained as reciprocal twins.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Canonical["Portable Repository Contract"]
        AgentsMD["AGENTS.md\nCanonical authority"]
        IntentRouter[".agents/contract/intents.yaml\nIntent routing"]
        CanonicalAgentRule[".agents/rules/*.md\nContract-system rules"]
    end

    subgraph Adapters["Current Harness Adapters"]
        OmOHook["OmO\nNative .omo rules injector"]
        ClaudeAdapter["Claude Code\nCLAUDE.md pointer + graph-only settings hooks"]
        CursorAdapter["Cursor / Windsurf\n.cursorrules graph guidance only"]
        CopilotAdapter["GitHub Copilot\ncopilot-instructions.md pointer"]
        SessionAdapter["Gemini / other harnesses\nSession/root AGENTS injection when available"]
    end

    subgraph TwinPair["Only Reciprocal Twin Pair"]
        OmOTwinRule[".omo/rules/*.md\nOmO-native copies"]
    end

    AgentsMD --> IntentRouter --> CanonicalAgentRule
    OmOHook --> OmOTwinRule
    ClaudeAdapter --> AgentsMD
    CopilotAdapter --> AgentsMD
    SessionAdapter -.-> AgentsMD
    CanonicalAgentRule <-->|"Twin Sync Contract\n(Exact Copy, No Symlinks)"| OmOTwinRule
```

Current adapter facts:

- OmO auto-loads `.omo/rules`; the contract system routes `.agents/rules`.
- Root [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) and [Copilot instructions](../../.github/copilot-instructions.md) point to `AGENTS.md`; Claude settings currently register graph hooks rather than rule mirrors.
- `.cursorrules` currently contains graph guidance, not a mirrored rule tree.
- No additional Claude/Cursor/Copilot/Gemini twin directories are asserted as implemented.

Harness injection order does not change repository authority. Root [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) remains controlling: Critical Rules → `docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` → `docs/GOVERNANCE.md` → matching path-scoped rules. Adapter convergence remains proposal **#5** below.

### The Twin Rules Synchronization Contract

- **Zero Divergence**: Every rule in `.agents/rules/<name>.md` has an exact twin at `.omo/rules/<name>.md`.
- **Reciprocal Headers**: Line 2 of every rule documents its counterpart relative path.
- **No Symlinks**: Symlinks are strictly prohibited because harness file-scanners (such as OmO's `realpathSync`) collapse symlinks into single candidates, defeating distance-weighted path matching.
- **Twin Editing Rule**: When editing any rule file, agents MUST apply the identical change to its twin in the same commit.

---

## 5. The Dev-Doc Triad & Active Workstream State Machine

Substantial or multi-session development tasks are governed by the **Dev-Doc Triad** in `dev/active/<task>/`. This structure enforces strict separation of concerns between architecture, execution, and ephemeral session memory.

> [!NOTE]
> **Local Working Memory & Gitignore Isolation**: Active workstreams in `dev/active/*` are gitignored to eliminate commit churn, task-checkbox noise, and branch merge conflicts. Agents and developers access, create, and update these files directly using native harness file tools by deterministic path. Only durable architectural decisions graduate to `docs/internal/adr/`, durable findings to `dev/_journal/`, and completed workstreams to `dev/backlog/`.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft: Task Initiated

    state "dev/active/<task>/" as ActiveWorkstream {
        state "plan.md (Canonical Design)" as PlanDoc

```

### Triad Single Responsibility Matrix

| Artifact | Canonical Responsibility | Strictly Forbidden Content | Update Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|
| `*-plan.md` | High-level architecture, design decisions, RFC 2119 contracts, `WHEN`/`THEN` scenarios, phase exit criteria, rollback handling. | Granular task checklists, `- [ ]` checkboxes, dynamic statuses (`IN PROGRESS`), ephemeral session progress. | Only when architectural direction or scope shifts. |
| `*-tasks.md` | Hot execution ledger, granular Red/Green/Refactor tasks, exact phase-owned paths, verification commands, declarative planned commit contracts, and task statuses (`[ ]`, `[x]`). | Long architectural narratives, trade-off debates, session handoff logs, commit hash recording. | During planning, after each subtask, and after each phase commit. |
| `*-context.md` | Ephemeral working memory for session pauses/handoffs, quick resume state, active blockers, loaded evidence ledger, validation baseline results. | Duplicate task checklists, full source code copies, redundant documentation paste, commit hash recording. | At start of session, on blockers, and before handoff/pause. |

### Single-Session Task-Branch & Phase-Close Protocol

Each active workstream runs in a single agentic session on a dedicated Git branch (`feat/<task-name>`). Commits occur immediately upon phase verification. Planning pre-authors declarative commit contracts; execution consumes them directly without loading `conventional-commit` or recording commit hashes in markdown (Git commit history is the single source of truth):

| Step | Required action | Observable evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Reconcile & stage | Check `git status --short`. Stage exact phase-owned files (`git add -- <paths>`). | Only files modified by the current phase are staged. No blind `git add .` or `git add -A`. |
| 2. Verify once | Run the phase verification: one Release build and one selected project test. | Build and test output clean and passing. |
| 3. Classify failures | Fix phase-attributable failures immediately. External shared-tree failures are noted without touching foreign code. | Working tree remains bounded to phase-owned scope. |
| 4. Execute planned commit | Commit staged files directly using the declarative title and description from `tasks.md`. Do not load `conventional-commit`. | Clean native Git commit (`git commit -m "..." -m "..."`). The Git log is the sole source of truth; no hashes recorded in markdown. |
| 5. Progress or graduate | Proceed to the next phase, or upon completing all phases, graduate the workstream (`dev/active/<task>/` -> `dev/backlog/<task>/`). | Working tree clean (`git status --short`). Release artifacts and teaching summary prepared. |

A phase-attributable failure blocks its commit. A proven unrelated failure does not authorize the agent to repair, stage, discard, or claim ownership of another contributor's work.

Representative `tasks.md` declarative commit contract:

```markdown
#### Planned Commit Contract
- **Title:** `fix(registration): reject expired holds before confirmation`
- **Description:** Keep registration and capacity state unchanged when confirmation references an expired inventory hold.
- **Changelog:** Public fix
- **Files:** `src/Registration/HoldConfirmation.cs`, `tests/Registration/HoldConfirmationTests.cs`
```

## 6. Test-Driven Development & Behavior-Bound Seam Architecture

The repository enforces strict **Test-First Invariant Task Sequencing** to eliminate **Post-Hoc Test Tautology ("The Ugly Mirror")**—the failure mode where tests are written after code and merely mirror implementation bugs.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph PlanContract["1. Behavioral Contract (in plan.md)"]

        CommitPhase["Phase Commit on Task Branch\n• Stage owned paths (git add -- <paths>)\n• Commit declarative tasks.md contract directly\n• No skill reload, no hash recording"]
    end

    PlanContract --> SeamDefinitions
    SeamDefinitions --> RedPhase
    RedPhase --> GreenPhase
    GreenPhase --> RefactorPhase

    VerificationPhase --> CommitPhase
```

### Core Testing Invariants

1. **Pre-Agreed Public Seams**: Tests verify behavior strictly through public interfaces (MediatR requests, HTTP routes, aggregate root methods), never by inspecting private internal state or mocking internal collaborators.
2. **Compilable Stubs in Red Phase**: In strongly-typed C#/.NET, invariant tests must compile to execute. Agents must author minimal compilable stub types/method signatures (returning default or throwing `NotImplementedException`) alongside the test so that the solution compiles and the test suite executes to produce a genuine behavioral RED failure, never a compile break.
3. **No Tautological Assertions**: Expected values must originate from an independent known-good literal or specification. Assertions that recompute expected values using the same formula as production code (`Assert.Equal(items.Sum(x => x.Price), result.Total)`) are strictly forbidden.
4. **No Interface Bypassing**: Tests must verify state transitions through the public interface. A test must not bypass the domain aggregate to assert directly against raw database tables.
5. **Mock Boundary Rule**: Mock **ONLY** external third-party infrastructure (payment gateways, external email delivery, system clock, random generators). **NEVER mock internal domain entities, aggregate roots, repositories, or MediatR handlers.** Use real domain entities and in-memory or Testcontainers-backed databases.

---

## 7. Disciplined Bug Diagnosis Protocol

Bug diagnosis follows a disciplined 6-phase falsifiable loop from `debug-issue`. Speculative debugging and premature code editing are strictly forbidden.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    BugReport(["Bug / Regression Reported"]) --> Phase1["Phase 1: Build Deterministic Red Feedback Loop\n(Spend 90% of effort here)\n• Author fast (<2s) TUnit test with --treenode-filter\n• OR minimal HTTP curl / integration harness\n• MUST assert user's exact symptom\n⚠️ NO CODE EDITING OR HYPOTHESIZING BEFORE THIS EXISTS"]
    
    Phase1 --> Phase2["Phase 2: Reproduce & Minimise\n• Verify failure matches user symptom\n• Strip inputs/config one by one\n• Retain ONLY load-bearing parameters"]
    
    Phase2 --> Phase3["Phase 3: 3–5 Ranked Falsifiable Hypotheses\nFormat: 'If <X> is root cause, then <changing Y>\nwill make bug disappear / <changing Z> will make it worse'"]
    
    Phase3 --> Phase4["Phase 4: Targeted Probing & Tagged Debug Logs\n• Use knowledge graph (callers, callees, flows)\n• Tag probes: [DEBUG-<id>] (e.g. [DEBUG-4a1f])\n• Ensures grep '[DEBUG-' leaves zero log pollution"]
    
    Phase4 --> Phase5["Phase 5: Fix & Regression Seam Verification\n• If no clean seam exists -> record Seam Deficiency Defect\n• Apply minimal fix to satisfy red test\n• Verify test turns GREEN\n• Re-run un-minimised Phase 1 loop"]
    
    Phase5 --> Phase6["Phase 6: Cleanup & Merge Gate\n• Remove all [DEBUG-...] probes\n• Document confirmed root cause in commit/summary\n• Run fast-loop test verification"]
    
    Phase6 --> Resolved(["Bug Defect Resolved & Verified"])
```

## 8. Two-Axis Review & Quality Gate Pipeline

Code review in ISLAMU Event evaluates pull requests along **two independent, non-polluting axes**, ensuring that clean code formatting does not mask missed functional requirements.

### The Fowler 12-Smell Baseline Checklist

| # | Code Smell | Diagnostic Tell in Diff | Required Refactoring Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Mysterious Name** | Vague identifiers (`data`, `temp`, `res`, `process()`) that obscure intent. | Rename using canonical domain glossary terms. |
| 2 | **Duplicated Code** | Similar logic shapes recurring across multiple handlers/controllers. | Extract to shared domain aggregate or application service. |
| 3 | **Feature Envy** | Method repeatedly reaching into another object's fields to perform calculations. | Move the method onto the object that owns the data. |
| 4 | **Primitive Obsession** | Raw `string`, `int`, or `Guid` representing domain concepts (e.g. email, money). | Encapsulate into a strongly-typed Value Object or Enum. |
| 5 | **Data Clumps** | The same 3+ parameters traveling together across multiple signatures. | Bundle parameters into a cohesive Record contract. |
| 6 | **Shotgun Surgery** | A single logical change forcing small edits across dozens of scattered files. | Consolidate related responsibilities into a single deep module. |
| 7 | **Divergent Change** | One class or file edited for multiple completely unrelated reasons. | Split class by single responsibility (CQRS command vs query). |
| 8 | **Speculative Generality** | Unused hooks, generic type parameters, or abstractions added "for the future". | Delete unused abstractions; keep implementation minimal (YAGNI). |
| 9 | **Message Chains** | Long property traversals (`a.B.C.D.GetState()`) violating the Law of Demeter. | Hide the walk behind a single method on the root object. |
| 10 | **Middle Man** | A class or service that merely delegates calls without enforcing invariants. | Cut the middle man; apply **The Deletion Test**. |
| 11 | **Repeated Switches** | Identical `switch`/`if` cascades on the same enum recurring across the codebase. | Replace with polymorphism or strategy dictionary. |
| 12 | **Refused Bequest** | A subclass or implementer that overrides and throws on inherited methods. | Replace inheritance with composition. |

## 9. Contributor & Agent Quick Command Reference

### Fast-Loop Development Commands

```bash
# 1. Fast TUnit Slicing during active subtask coding (~1.5s):
dotnet run --project tests/Event.Application.UnitTests/Event.Application.UnitTests.csproj --no-build -- --treenode-filter "/*/*/*<TargetTestClassName>/*"

# 2. Phase-End Verification (Run ONCE after all phase tasks are complete):
dotnet build --configuration Release --verbosity quiet
dotnet test --project tests/<TargetProject>.Tests/<TargetProject>.Tests.csproj --configuration Release --verbosity quiet

# 3. Architecture & Convention Integrity Check:
dotnet test --project tests/Event.Architecture.Tests/Event.Architecture.Tests.csproj --configuration Release --verbosity quiet

# 4. Immediate phase close on dedicated task branch (feat/<task-name>):
git status --short
# Stage exact files owned by this phase
git add -- <phase-owned-path-1> <phase-owned-path-2>
# Commit directly using the declarative tasks.md contract:
git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <benefit-led phase outcome>" \
  -m "<phase-owned motivation, data flow, and required trailers>"
git status --short
# Git log is the single source of truth; no commit hashes recorded in markdown.

# 5. Markdown & Diff Integrity Check (Tier 4 / Documentation tasks):
git diff --check -- .agents/ docs/ dev/
```

### Critical Negative Constraints (What is FORBIDDEN)

> [!CAUTION]
> **Enforced Repository Invariants:**
> - ❌ **NO Ad-hoc Python/Node.js Scripts**: Agents must never generate or run `python`, `python3`, `node`, `npm` scratch scripts. Use native agent tools and POSIX Bash. Persistent dev tools belong in `eng/scripts/` or `eng/tools/` as C# scripts (`dotnet run eng/.../*.cs`).
> - ❌ **NO Hard-Coded Secrets**: Never put passwords, connection strings, or tokens in source code, `AppHost.cs`, or test fixtures. Secrets originate strictly from **Infisical** or **`.env`**.
> - ❌ **NO Repositories Returning DTOs**: Repositories return Domain Entities only. DTO mapping belongs strictly in MediatR handlers.
> - ❌ **NO DI for Validators**: FluentValidation validators must be manually instantiated in handlers.
> - ❌ **NO Hand-Editing EF Migrations**: Migrations are generated artifacts (`dotnet ef migrations add`). Never manually edit migration files or model snapshots.
> - ❌ **NO UI Authorization Inspection**: Blazor client affordances must be gated strictly by inspecting HAL `_links` presence, never by local role/claim checking.

## 10. Lightweight Workflow Guard

The repository intentionally does not implement an “Agent OS.” There are no
workstream manifests, concatenated plan/task/context digests, approval receipt
chains, file claims, heartbeats, lock daemons, persistent goal state machines,
custom context packet compilers, or harness-wide orchestration authority. Git
commits provide provenance; branches and worktrees provide concurrency.

`eng/agent-workflow` is a small, read-only guard with two commands:

```bash
dotnet run --project eng/agent-workflow/src/ISLAMU.AgentWorkflow/ISLAMU.AgentWorkflow.csproj -- validate-intents .agents/contract/intents.yaml
dotnet run --project eng/agent-workflow/src/ISLAMU.AgentWorkflow/ISLAMU.AgentWorkflow.csproj -- validate-commit -- git commit --only -m "message" -- src/ExactFile.cs docs/ExactFile.md
```

The first command checks that the canonical intents catalog is one bounded,
valid UTF-8 YAML document. The second checks only that a described `git commit`
uses distinct literal file pathspecs after `--`; it rejects `.`, directories,
globs, traversal, rooted paths, Git pathspec magic, controls, and duplicates.
The guard never executes Git or mutates repository state.
