## Critical Rules Summary

These rules are **non-negotiable**. Violations break architectural integrity.

| # | Rule | Rationale |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | Repositories return **entities**, never DTOs | Single responsibility; mapping belongs in handlers |
| 2 | Validators use **manual instantiation**, not DI | Fine-grained control; consistent pattern |
| 3 | Navigation properties are **readonly for writes** | Tenant isolation; explicit repository operations |
| 4 | Use `Guid` for core aggregates, `int` for most lookups, `long` only for large size/cursor fields | Matches current domain and persistence conventions |
| 5 | No default values in entity properties | Explicit initialization; clear value origins |
| 6 | Do not delete seemingly unused `using` statements blindly | Verify with build/tests before cleanup |
| 7 | Create/update commands typically return `BaseCommandResponse<Guid>` | Matches current CQRS response contracts |
| 8 | GET = AllowAnonymous, Write = Authorize | Public discovery; protected writes |
| 9 | UserId extraction fallback is `sub` -> `nameidentifier` -> `sid` | Provider compatibility; claim name variations |
| 10 | Use file-scoped namespaces | C# 10+ convention; cleaner code |

**For detailed examples**: See `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` and relevant skills.

## Naming Conventions

### General Rules

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Public members | PascalCase | `Title`, `CreatedAt` |
| Private fields | _camelCase with underscore | `_eventRepository`, `_resourceAssembler`, `_mediator`, `_userContext`, `_cache` |
| Parameters | camelCase | `eventId`, `createDto` |
| Constants | PascalCase | `DefaultPageSize` |
| Interfaces | IPascalCase | `IEventRepository` |
| Async methods | Suffix with Async | `GetEventsAsync()` |

### Entity Naming

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Core entity | Singular noun | `Event`, `Organization` |
| Lookup/enum entity | Singular noun | `EventType`, `ApprovalStatus` |
| Join table | Combined names | `EventCategories`, `EventTags` |
| Aspect table | Parent + Details | `EventIslamicDetails` |

### DTO Naming

| Type | Pattern | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| Full details | `{Entity}Dto` | Read operations with all fields |
| List view | `{Entity}ListDto` | Minimal fields for lists |
| Create payload | `Create{Entity}Dto` | Write operations (no ID) |
| Update payload | `Update{Entity}Dto` | Write operations (ID required) |

### Handler Naming

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Command | `Create{Entity}Command` | `CreateEventCommand` |
| Command Handler | `Create{Entity}CommandHandler` | `CreateEventCommandHandler` |
| Query | `Get{Entity}ListRequest` | `GetEventListRequest` |
| Query Handler | `Get{Entity}ListRequestHandler` | `GetEventListRequestHandler` |

### Repository Naming

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Interface | `I{Entity}Repository` | `IEventRepository` |
| Implementation | `{Entity}Repository` | `EventRepository` |
| Generic base | `IGenericRepository<T, TId>` | Base interface |

## Layer Responsibilities

### What Goes Where

| Concern | Layer | Location |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Entity definition | Domain | `Event.Domain/` |
| Business rules | Domain | Entity methods, value objects |
| Repository interface | Application | `Contracts/Persistence/` |
| Command/Query | Application | `Features/{Feature}/Requests/` |
| Handler logic | Application | `Features/{Feature}/Handlers/` |
| DTO definition | Application | `DTOs/` and feature folders |
| Validation rules | Application | Feature validators or DTO validator folders |
| Repository implementation | Persistence | `Repositories/` |
| EF configuration | Persistence | `Configurations/` |
| External service impl | Infrastructure | Service classes |
| API endpoint | Presentation | `Controllers/` |
| UI component | Presentation | `Components/` |

### Dependency Rules

| Layer | Can Reference | Cannot Reference |
|-------|--------------|------------------|
| Domain | Nothing | Application, Infrastructure, Presentation |
| Application | Domain | Infrastructure, Presentation |
| Infrastructure | Domain, Application | Presentation |
| Presentation | All | (Entry point) |

### Aggregate Lifecycle Authority

Lifecycle state changes are semantic aggregate operations. Application coordinators acquire tenant-qualified locks, ask the tracked aggregate to accept an expected-state transition, and then persist it through an entity-first repository. Persistence may provide locking, transaction, query, and storage primitives, but it must not expose status-transition commands, reconstruct Domain transition rules, or update lifecycle status columns directly. API HAL policies consume the same Domain decision surface as commands and workers; transport status strings are representations, never an authorization or lifecycle authority.

---

## Design Principles

### SOLID Application

| Principle | How We Apply It |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **S**ingle Responsibility | One handler per command/query; one repository per entity |
| **O**pen/Closed | Extend via new handlers, not modifying existing |
| **L**iskov Substitution | All repository implementations honor interface contracts |
| **I**nterface Segregation | Small, focused interfaces per entity type |
| **D**ependency Inversion | Application defines interfaces; Infrastructure implements |

### Additional Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **DRY** | Generic repository base; shared validation patterns |
| **KISS** | Simple handlers; one responsibility per class |
| **YAGNI** | Don't add abstractions until needed |
| **Explicit > Implicit** | Clear initialization; obvious dependencies |
| **Fail Fast** | Validate early; return errors immediately |

---

## Pattern Selection Guide

### When to Use Each Pattern

| Scenario | Pattern | Reasoning |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Simple CRUD | CQRS + Generic Repository | Standard approach |
| Complex query | Custom repository method | Optimize for specific needs |
| Cross-entity operation | Domain service | Coordinate multiple entities |
| External integration | Infrastructure service | Isolate external dependencies |
| Validation | FluentValidation | Consistent, testable rules |
| Mapping | AutoMapper | Convention-based, less boilerplate |

### When NOT to Use Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why to Avoid |
|--------------|--------------|
| Repository for simple lookups | Over-engineering |
| Domain service for single-entity ops | Should be in handler |
| Generic repository for complex queries | Loses optimization |
| MediatR behaviors for one-off logic | Use handler directly |

---

## Decision Framework

### Choosing The Secrets-Authority Contribution Intent

| Change | Primary intent | Additive secondary intent |
|--------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Deployment-owned secret source, resolver policy, persistence removal, rotation, safe visibility, or topology convergence | [`secrets-authority`](../../.agents/contract/intents.yaml) | Apply the path-matched bootstrap, migration, API, HAL, OpenAPI, Blazor, or CI intent declared by `secrets-authority.routing` |

The primary intent owns Tier 1 authority, confidentiality, reset, convergence, and greenfield-removal constraints. Secondary obligations remain additive except for the single declared OpenAPI compatibility conflict: secrets-authority removal of obsolete secret-bearing compatibility controls that workstream, while every other OpenAPI gate still applies.

### Choosing The Strong-Typing And Reflection Remediation Contribution Intent

| Change | Primary intent | Scope and constraints |
|--------|----------------|-----------------------|
| Mixed product-source and test strong-typing remediation, runtime-dispatch elimination, typed DID/identity/authorization boundaries, and assurance audit | [`strong-typing-refactor`](../../.agents/contract/intents.yaml) | Governs cross-layer strong-typing refactoring, invariant-disposition before deletion, no backward-compatibility, and zero-drift generated artifacts |

### Choosing ID Types

| Type | Use When | Examples |
|------|----------|----------|
| `Guid` | Main entities, distributed systems | Event, Organization, User |
| `int` | Lookup tables, enums, sequential IDs | EventType, ApprovalStatus |
| `long` | Large sequences, file sizes, cursors | Pagination, storage metrics |

### Choosing Validation Location

| Location | Use When |
|----------|----------|
| DTO Validator | Input validation, format checks |
| Handler | Business rules requiring data access |
| Entity | Invariants that must always hold |
| Controller | Quick format/auth checks |

### Choosing Query Strategy

| Strategy | Use When |
|----------|----------|
| Repository method | Standard queries, reusable |
| Handler-specific query | One-off, optimized for use case |
| Specification pattern | Complex, composable filters |

---

## Canonical Record-Selection Policy

Use records for handwritten contracts whose meaning is immutable data with value equality. Apply this policy by horizontal Clean Architecture ownership only: Domain, then Application, then API/OpenAPI, then generated client/Blazor; do not organize the migration as feature vertical slices.

See [RECORD_CONTRACTS.md](RECORD_CONTRACTS.md) for the layer-by-layer implementation workflow, persistence boundary, generated-client policy, and focused verification commands.

### Selection

- A concrete handwritten MediatR request defaults to a sealed record. A retained class needs a current, reasoned shrinking-baseline entry.
- Use a positional record for a short, stable contract with semantically distinct parameters. Use a nominal record with `init`/`required` members for long or optional contracts, named-construction safety, attributes, or PATCH presence semantics.
- Use a `readonly record struct` only for a small, self-contained value with correct copy/value semantics; use a sealed record class for reference-bearing value data when appropriate.

### Intentional Classes

Retain classes for EF entities and outbox lifecycle entities; services, handlers, controllers, and validators; mutable Blazor edit/component state; and generated protocol shapes whose framework behavior requires mutation, HAL identity, inheritance, file/exception semantics, or request-body population. Plain response/value contracts emitted by NSwag are transformed into nominal record classes through the repository-owned Roslyn pipeline. The exact mutable generated-response inventory lives in `eng/tools/Explore.GeneratedContracts/mutable-generated-contracts.txt`; each entry has observed post-construction UI or service mutation. Immutable `BaseCommandResponse<T>` results and their concrete payload-bearing descendants use valid-state record factories. These are exclusions by semantics or ownership, not record-policy debt.

### Immutability, Equality, and Logging

Records are shallowly immutable. Every published collection-bearing handwritten record must expose a serializer-compatible read-only or immutable member and defensively copy mutable inputs. Generated nominal records preserve NSwag collection shapes and keep only `[JsonExtensionData] AdditionalProperties` publicly settable because System.Text.Json AOT requires mutable extension-data population; all other eligible generated properties are `init`. Their generator-owned `PrintMembers` implementation omits every member value so accidental interpolation cannot enumerate PII, tokens, or free text. `ReadOnlyMemory<byte>` preserves base64 wire behavior for binary payloads; read-only lists/dictionaries and immutable collections preserve JSON arrays/objects, PATCH presence, HAL extension data, and caller ownership. Adapters replace immutable collections (`SetItem`, record copy, or a new snapshot) instead of mutating through an indexer. Record equality does not make array or list contents sequence-equal; test sequence semantics explicitly where they matter. Never log, interpolate, or destructure a whole record; log only bounded, approved scalar diagnostics.

### Trusted Authority

`UserId` and `TenantId` that represent the current caller or current tenant are never body authority. Introduce them from established server principal, tenant, route, or trusted-adapter context only when the request's authorization or business intent uses them. A body may carry a legitimate target ID only for an operation that manages that target, and the server must authorize it independently.

### Executable Contract Classification And TDD

Record-policy tests derive the current contract surface from compiled types,
serialization behavior, and generator-owned machine manifests rather than
historical source inventories. `PublishedCollectionContractArchitectureTests`
classifies published collection contracts across Domain, Application, API, and
Blazor; `published-collection-contract-dispositions.json` contains only
current, reasoned framework or ownership exceptions. Generated-client tests
verify policy-derived eligibility, compiled `init` semantics, value-free
diagnostic printing, AOT extension-data behavior, protected framework classes,
and the generator-owned mutable-state manifest. These structured manifests
must classify the complete current machine contract, but must not pin prose,
source tokens, or obsolete debt. Before a behavioral conversion, write focused
tests for consumed equality, one-fact `with` variants, caller-mutation
isolation, JSON construction, PATCH omitted/clear/replacement behavior, and
authority trust boundaries.

## Code Quality Standards

### Required in Every File

- File-scoped namespace
- All necessary using statements preserved
- Async suffix on async methods
- CancellationToken passed through

### Required in Every Entity

- Primary key property
- TenantId (for tenant-scoped entities)
- Audit fields (CreatedAt, UpdatedAt)
- Soft delete support (IsDeleted)

### Required in Every Controller

- Concrete controller class — **generic CRUD or lookup base controllers (`CrudControllerBase<...>`, `LookupControllerBase<...>`) are strictly banned**. Controllers are HTTP transport adapters; generic action inheritance creates an inflexible "framework inside a framework", obscures route names, and breaks OpenAPI metadata fidelity.
- Inherit `EventControllerBase` for request identity (`CurrentUserId`/`RequiredUserId`) and strong ETag concurrency parsing (`TryParseConcurrencyStamp`), or a domain-family base class when split controllers share an exact multi-step domain protocol.
- Route attribute with version (`[Route("api/[controller]")]`)
- Explicit OpenAPI and route name attributes on every action (`Name = RouteNames.Xxx`, `[EndpointSummary]`, `[EndpointDescription]`, `[ProducesResponseType]`)
- Authorization attributes matching the action's `EndpointClassification`
- Proper HTTP status codes with ProblemDetails for error bodies (via `CommandFailurePolicy` or `MapCommandResponse`)

---

## API Contract Rules

> **Scope**: Every controller action in `Explore.API` is part of a **governed product artifact** — the OpenAPI document at `/openapi/event-api.json`. Both server consumers (integrations, webhooks) and the generated `IEventApiClient` (used by `Explore.Blazor` and `Explore.Blazor.Client`) depend on this contract being stable, unambiguous, and ergonomic.
>
> These rules are enforced by tests in `Event.API.IntegrationTests/Features/ContractInvariantsTests.cs` and `Explore.Blazor.Client.Tests/ApiClientNamingTests.cs`. Violations fail CI.

### Versioning Strategy (Multi-Reader, Non-URL)

Version is negotiated via **three equal-status readers**, never via URL segment:

| Reader | Syntax | Primary consumer |
|---|---|---|
| Media type | `Accept: application/json;v=0.1` | REST-pure clients, HATEOAS navigation |
| Query string | `?api-version=0.1` | Webhooks, ad-hoc tools, browser debugging |
| Custom header | `X-Api-Version: 0.1` | Service-to-service integrations that cannot set media type |

The URL-segment pattern (`/api/v0.1/...`) is **banned**. It is the root cause of duplicate OpenAPI operations, it clutters HATEOAS links, and it prevents content negotiation from being the source of truth. Controllers carry exactly one `[Route("api/[controller]")]` attribute. Runtime requests to `/api/v{n}/...` must return 404.

### Endpoint Classification

Every controller action must carry exactly one of the following classifications, enforced by an architecture test:

| Class | Semantics | Authorization | Rate limit baseline |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Public** | Safe for unauthenticated read. No tenant mutation. | `[AllowAnonymous]` | `global` |
| **Authenticated** | Any logged-in user. Tenant-scoped or user-scoped write, or privileged read. | `[Authorize]` (no roles required) | `authenticated` or `write` |
| **Admin** | Operator / setup / diagnostics. Not exposed to the generated client. | `[Authorize(Roles=...)]` or `[SetupSecretRequired]` | `setup_secret` or `authenticated` |
| **PublicTransactional** | Anonymous tenant mutation for narrowly scoped guest flows. Unsafe verbs only. | `[AllowAnonymous]`; browser traffic is protected at the BFF boundary, not with API antiforgery metadata. | `public_transactional` |

The classification lives in controller action metadata via the `[EndpointClassification(EndpointClass.X)]` attribute (`Explore.API.Attributes`) and is the single source of truth for OpenAPI tagging (injected as `x-endpoint-class` operation extension by `EndpointClassificationTransformer`), client-generation filters, and Cerbos policy scaffolding. Every controller action must carry exactly one classification (class-level attribute is inherited by actions; action-level attribute overrides). Enforced by `EndpointClassificationArchitectureTests` in `Event.Architecture.Tests`.

`PublicTransactional` endpoints must explicitly use `[EnableRateLimiting("public_transactional")]`. The policy is a fixed window of 10 requests per 60 seconds per effective remote IP, with queue limit 0. `POST` actions also require `[RequireIdempotencyKey]`; the API receives no antiforgery metadata because only browser traffic that crosses the BFF is subject to BFF antiforgery validation.

### Operation IDs

- **Every action has an `operationId`.** `operationId` is the filename of the generated client method (plus `Async` suffix). Missing IDs cause NSwag to emit placeholder names (`GET`, `GET2`, `TenantDELETE2`) that break ergonomics and block the HATEOAS link-name alignment.
- **Operation IDs are unique across the whole document.** Uniqueness is a tested invariant, not an emergent behavior of good naming.
- **Naming pattern:** `{ControllerShortName}_{ActionName}` (PascalCase, underscore-separated). Example: `Tenant_GetById`, `EventRegistration_ListByEvent`. This is policy, not physics — see [NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md](NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md) for rationale and exceptions.
- **Route Name ↔ Operation ID alignment is intentional.** `[HttpGet(Name = "Tenant_GetById")]` and its derived `operationId` should match. They are kept aligned by convention, not by runtime equality — both are allowed to drift independently if a specific action needs it, but drift must be documented on the action.

### Banned Names

The following method names on `IEventApiClient` are always defects. CI fails if any appear:

- Any method whose name matches the regex `\d+Async$` (e.g. `Foo2Async`, `TenantGET3Async`).
- Any method whose name equals one of `GETAsync`, `POSTAsync`, `PUTAsync`, `DELETEAsync`, `PATCHAsync` — with or without a digit suffix.
- Any operationId equal to a raw HTTP verb (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) or a raw verb followed by digits.

These are NSwag's collision-disambiguation fallbacks and carry zero semantic information.

### Client-Ergonomics Bar

Generated client methods must be **readable without the OpenAPI doc**:

- **Collections vs single**: `ListEventsAsync` not `GetEventsAsync`; `GetEventAsync(id)` not `GetEventsAsync(id)`.
- **Mutations are business actions**: `PublishEventAsync`, `ApproveRegistrationAsync` — not `PutEvent2Async`.
- **No verb-only names**: A method called `GetAsync` on a 100+ entity client is a contract defect regardless of whether the compiler accepts it.

The ergonomics bar is a governed quality gate. Violations block release, though they do not block routine dev builds (they surface as schema-diff warnings in CI and fail only the explicit `ApiClientNamingTests`).

### NSwag Trailing-Parameter Convention

Every method generated by NSwag (`SingleClientFromOperationId` mode) ends with three optional parameters:

```csharp
string? api_version = null, string? x_Api_Version = null, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default
```

Callers passing `CancellationToken` must use a **named argument** (`cancellationToken: ct`) to avoid routing the token into the `api_version` string parameter. NSubstitute mock setups must insert `Arg.Any<string?>(), Arg.Any<string?>()` before `Arg.Any<CancellationToken>()`. This convention is stable across regenerations and must not be hand-modified in `EventApiClient.g.cs`.

**Stabilization plan**: `dev/active/api-contract-stabilization/api-contract-stabilization-plan.md`.

### Contract Ownership & Change Control

- **OpenAPI changes require PR review.** The checked-in `schemas/openapi_islamu-event.json` is an artifact of CI regeneration — it must never be hand-edited. Any PR touching controller signatures, route attributes, `[ApiVersion]`, or `[ProducesResponseType]` is implicitly a contract change.
- **Schema-diff is surfaced in CI.** Before 1.0 it is non-blocking (visibility only). At 1.0 it flips to blocking for breaking diffs.
- **Regeneration is a discrete step.** Do not regenerate `Explore.Blazor.Client/Clients/EventApiClient.g.cs` casually. Regenerate only when the API-side contract is stable and a tracked change-set justifies it.

### Authoring Checklist (new controller action)

1. Add `[HttpGet(Name = "X_Y")]` (or equivalent verb attribute) with a stable name.
2. Add `[ProducesResponseType]` for every possible response shape, including 400/401/403/404.
3. Pick an **Endpoint Classification** and apply the matching authorization attribute(s).
4. Confirm API contract tests still pass (`dotnet test --project Event.API.IntegrationTests/Event.API.IntegrationTests.csproj --configuration Release --verbosity quiet`).
5. If the generated client needs regeneration, open a separate contract PR — do not mix contract and feature work.

## CI/CD Governance

GitHub Actions gates, branch-protection policy, environment settings, artifact retention, fork PR rules, and generated-artifact review rules live in [CI_CD_GOVERNANCE.md](CI_CD_GOVERNANCE.md).

Key rules:

- Keep required workflow/job names stable unless branch protection is migrated in the same change.
- Required checks must be always-present or have a documented no-op path; do not make a path-skipped workflow required without a wrapper gate.
- OpenAPI and NSwag client drift is governed CI evidence. Contributors regenerate through the documented command path and commit the generated artifacts.
- Production deployment approval, branch restrictions, environment secrets, secret scanning, and push protection are GitHub repository or organization settings, not application configuration.

## Code Review Checklist

### Command Handler PR Review

Before approving any command handler PR, verify:

- **Multi-step writes → `IUnitOfWork`**: If the handler performs more than one write operation (across any repository or service), confirm `IUnitOfWork.ExecuteInTransactionAsync` wraps all writes.
- **Pre-validation outside lambda**: Validation, authorization checks, and read-only pre-fetches must be outside the transaction lambda.
- **Post-commit side effects after lambda**: Cache invalidation, metrics, external notifications must happen *after* `ExecuteInTransactionAsync` returns — never inside the lambda.
- **Retry-safety**: All `Guid.NewGuid()` / timestamps used as IDs must be generated before the lambda (captured via closure). No HTTP calls, broker publishes, or emails inside the lambda.
- **No nested transactions**: Handlers must not call services that internally use `IUnitOfWork` while already inside a transaction.

See `dev/active/unitofwork-pattern/unitofwork-pattern-context.md` for the canonical reference implementation.

## AI Contribution Routing

Every change — human or agent — routes through the Contribution Contract before editing. The contract answers **eight** deterministic questions (intent, rules, must-read files, may-change paths, must-run tests, docs-to-update, PR checklist, forbidden-without-approval). See [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) §1 and [`.agents/contract/README.md`](../../.agents/contract/README.md).

### Context Maintenance

- Benchmark scenarios live in `.agents/benchmarks/cold-start-tasks.yaml` to measure cold-start agent success.

If a rule in `.agents/rules/` appears to conflict with `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` or this file, the canonical doc wins and the rule file must be fixed per [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) §4.
