# ADR-025: Provider-Neutral Release Governance

> **Status:** Accepted for implementation; automation is not active
> **Date:** 2026-08-13
> **Decision owners:** Platform/Ops and Project Steward

## Context

The current release process is manual SemVer tagging with manually authored GitHub
Releases. It remains the operative process until the planned release-engine and its
controls are implemented, verified, and activated. The prior git-cliff report is a
research/provenance record, not architecture authority.

## Decision

1. The canonical release core is provider-neutral. Every release declares a
   version-line label `v<major>.<minor>`, which classifies the release and never names
   a ref. `develop` has no generated `Unreleased` changelog writes.
2. ISLAMU-owned release-engine policy decides commit validity, inclusion, impact,
   version compatibility, range/tag selection, trust validation, and evidence.
   git-cliff is a pinned renderer only: it receives normalized context and performs
   no policy, provider, network, or executable-processor work.
3. Final attestation runs only from a separately promoted trusted bundle containing
   the release engine, policy, renderer configuration, tool lock, context contract,
   and signer roots. Candidate source and configuration are input data, never final
   authority.
4. **The tag object is the sole release identity.** Attestation reads only the
   annotated tag object, the preparation commit `B` it targets, the tree at `B`, and
   ancestry from the base tag; it never resolves `refs/heads/*`. Each release has
   exactly one final preparation commit `B`, which is the candidate-attestation commit,
   the SSH-signed annotated tag target, the committed-note commit, and the stable `main`
   target for the newest stable release. A squash, merge, or rebase produces a different
   object and invalidates the candidate. Branch compare-and-swap survives only as a
   precondition of a mutating push.
10. Version tags own the `refs/heads/v*` glob; no branch may be created there.
    Maintenance branches are named `release/<major>.<minor>`, are opened lazily from a
    verified signed stable tag only when a real backport exists, and are disposable.
5. `release.yaml` and `summary.md` are the only human-owned release inputs.
   `release-notes.md` is fully generated; no mixed ownership markers or manual tag
   message duplication are used.
6. Canonical context, notes, and manifests are deterministic: UTF-8 without BOM,
   LF, NFC, invariant ordering, explicit release date, full object IDs, and no
   wall-clock, provider identity, or author identity. Candidate and final manifests
   are separate so post-tag identity does not create a hash cycle.
7. Release tags are SSH-signed annotated tags verified against the bundled signer
   policy. The tag object ID, signer, and commit are final evidence; a forge badge is
   not authority.
8. Embargoed security details use a restricted lane outside the public checkout and
   normal candidate artifacts. Only approved disclosure fields cross the public
   boundary.
9. Provider adapters transport explicit inputs, trusted bundles, artifacts, and
   protected ref operations. They may create noncanonical enrichment, but cannot
   affect canonical release identity. No compatibility shim is needed for the
   unshipped report design.

## Consequences

**Superseded model.** Decision 4 originally bound release identity to the mutable
branch ref `refs/heads/<line>`: the validator required the candidate to equal that
branch head, and the candidate/final manifests recorded `releaseBranchRef` and
`releaseLineHeadOid`. That model is wrong, because a release must stay verifiable
indefinitely and provider-independently: `v0.1.0` stopped verifying the moment `v0.1.1`
advanced the branch, and never verified at all in a clone that fetched only tags. It
was replaced on 2026-08-23 with the tag-anchored model above. The companion design that
eagerly provisioned a `v<major>.<minor>` branch per release from `develop` was rejected
in the same review: such a branch contains commits that were never in the release, and
a tag already reconstructs the line exactly.

The release engine is a small offline tool, not a service, provider SDK, or plugin
framework. Operators retain approval, tag creation, publication, and deployment.
Policy or renderer changes require their own trusted-bundle promotion before they can
affect final attestation. Existing semantic-version documents remain a preserved
pre-automation baseline until the prospective cutover is explicitly approved.
