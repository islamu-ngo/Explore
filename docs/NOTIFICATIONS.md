Notifications are authenticated, user-owned, tenant-scoped in-app records. They power the notification bell, notification panel, and full inbox page. Event-published actor-subscription fanout and event-moderation attendee fanout are implemented through the transactional outbox and create durable in-app `Notification` rows. The SSE stream is a one-way refresh hint for unread count/inbox state; it does not replace durable notification rows, list/detail APIs, SMTP email delivery, push delivery, or external delivery receipts.

## Lifecycle Channel Model

The lifecycle-email implementation defines one `NotificationIntent` per business occurrence/recipient and one `NotificationDelivery` per selected channel. In-app notification and email are sibling deliveries, not fallback intents. A failed or unavailable optional email therefore leaves the required in-app delivery on the same logical intent.

The policy snapshot records channel requiredness, policy/template version, consent purpose, preference result, disclosure/link authority, and recipient-address source. Dispatch can narrow that ceiling using current state but cannot add a channel, purpose, private location, or link. Reporter case-update and follow-up consent are independent and default false; heavy moderation is generic/linkless; Osprey remains signal-only; Coop converges on the same decision execution path after its durable effect handoff.

## Lifecycle

| State Or Action | Implemented Behavior |
|---|---|
| Create / store | Notification records store tenant, user, scope, type, reason, entity, actor context, read/archive/snooze state, and soft-delete state. |
| Actor subscription fanout | Event publication writes an internal `EventPublishedNotificationFanoutRequested` outbox message. The fanout service scans active organization/group actor subscriptions and creates durable in-app notification rows for active tenant-local subscribers. |
| Moderation attendee fanout | Light moderation writes `EventLightModeratedNotificationFanoutRequested` and creates preference-aware in-app rows. Heavy redaction instead commits one immediate generic `NotificationFanoutOccurrence` pointer with the irreversible moderation record; the frozen-audience worker atomically creates required linkless in-app delivery plus required email-channel state for each eligible attendee. |
| Deduplication | Fanout notifications use deterministic `Notification.DeduplicationKey` values so outbox retries and duplicate dispatches do not create duplicate inbox rows. Moderation fanout keys include tenant, moderation record, and recipient. |
| Fanout progress | `NotificationFanoutRun` records source event or moderation-record metadata, cursor, status, and aggregate counts so fanout can be retried and inspected without storing recipient PII. |
| List | User-scoped list retrieval supports paging and filters from the API and full inbox UI. |
| Detail | Detail retrieval is ownership-checked for the current user. |
| Unread count | API and bell use unread count for the badge. |
| Real-time refresh hint | Authenticated SSE at `GET /api/notification/stream` emits minimal unread-count refresh hints; it does not carry notification bodies or replace list/detail APIs. |
| Browser Web Push | Authenticated users explicitly enroll one browser device. A durable dispatch outbox sends VAPID-authenticated, encrypted, generic refresh payloads and removes stale subscriptions on push-service `404`/`410` responses. |
| Mark read | Single notification read and bulk mark-all-read are implemented. |
| Archive | Archive and unarchive are implemented. |
| Snooze | Snooze and unsnooze are implemented with a `snoozedUntil` value. |
| Delete | Delete is implemented as soft delete, not permanent deletion. |

There is no implemented mark-unread endpoint. Do not document read state as reversible unless source adds that operation.

## API Surface

All notification endpoints require an authenticated user. Handler and repository logic enforce current-user ownership; there is no separate admin role requirement for a user's own inbox.

| Action | Endpoint |
|---|---|
| List notifications | `GET /api/notification` |
| Get notification detail | `GET /api/notification/{id}` |
| Get unread count | `GET /api/notification/unread-count` |
| Stream refresh hints | `GET /api/notification/stream` (`text/event-stream`) |
| Mark one read | `PATCH /api/notification/{id}/read` |
| Mark all read | `POST /api/notification/read-all` |
| Archive or unarchive | `PATCH /api/notification/{id}/archive?archive=true|false` |
| Snooze or unsnooze | `PATCH /api/notification/{id}/snooze?snoozedUntil=...` |
| Soft delete | `DELETE /api/notification/{id}` |
| Current-user preference matrix | `GET /api/notification/preferences/me` |
| Save current-user preferences | `PUT /api/notification/preferences/me` |
| Set current-user mute | `PUT /api/notification/preferences/me/mute` |
| Get public Web Push configuration | `GET /api/notification/web-push/config` |
| Get current browser subscription status | `GET /api/notification/web-push/subscription?deviceIdentifier=...` |
| Subscribe current browser | `POST /api/notification/web-push/subscriptions` |
| Unsubscribe current browser | `DELETE /api/notification/web-push/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}` |
| Organization preference matrix | `GET|PUT /api/organization/{id}/notification-preferences` and `PUT /api/organization/{id}/notification-preferences/mute` |
| Group preference matrix | `GET|PUT /api/group/{id}/notification-preferences` and `PUT /api/group/{id}/notification-preferences/mute` |

When documenting filters, use the source API names. For notification type filtering, use `notificationTypeId`; do not copy stale shorthand such as `type` unless the controller changes.

Actor-subscription state and mutations are separate authenticated endpoints under `/api/actor-subscriptions`. The API exposes current-user subscription state, subscribe, unsubscribe, and notification-level update flows. UI affordances for subscription actions must be gated from HAL `_links` on actor, event organizer, and actor-subscription resources; clients must not infer those actions from local roles or claims.

Notification preference responses are HAL resources. The Blazor matrix renders `save` and `set-mute` actions only when the server emits those links.

## UI Behavior

| Surface | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Notification bell | Shows unread badge, listens for SSE refresh hints, keeps polling as fallback, and opens the panel without marking notifications read just because the panel opened. |
| Notification panel | Shows scope tabs, loads more items, supports item actions, and links to the full inbox. |
| Full inbox page | Supports filters for reason, unread-only, archived-only, and snoozed-only; includes mark-all-read. |
| Notification item | Displays scope/type/reason presentation and navigates to known entity URLs when mappable. |
| Preference matrix | Lets authorized users choose Email and In-App channels by category for current-user, organization, and group scopes; the current-user matrix also exposes Push enrollment when the browser and server support it. Required categories remain locked by server metadata; global mute suppresses non-essential delivery without deleting saved choices. |
| Browser Web Push | Current-user settings show an explicit Enable action only when the server emits the HAL affordance. Denied permission is terminal until the user changes browser settings; Disable unsubscribes the browser and deactivates the owned server row. |

Clicking a notification item navigates only when the item can be mapped to a supported route: events use `/events/{id}`, organizations use `/organization/profile/{id}`, and groups use `/group/profile/{id}`. Unsupported entity types, including event sessions without a dedicated route, should not be routed to guessed URLs. The item click itself is not the read-state operation; read state is handled by explicit user actions and read endpoints.

## Event Moderation Fanout

Light moderation and heavy redaction deliberately use different notification contracts.

| Moderation Kind | Outbox Payload | Created Notification |
|---|---|---|
| Light moderation | `EventLightModeratedNotificationFanoutRequested` contains tenant id, event id, moderation record id, event title, source actor id, and moderation time. | Uses `EventUpdated`, links to the event entity, and may include the event title because the event content is preserved. |
| Heavy redaction | `NotificationFanoutOccurrenceRequested` contains only tenant id, occurrence id, and schema version. The occurrence is sourced from the irreversible moderation record and its source decision, when present; its business payload consists only of empty safe JSON objects. | Uses required `General` in-app delivery with no `NotificationEntityTypeId` or `EntityId`, plus required `ModerationAvailabilityRequired` email-channel state. SMTP work exists only for a current verified persisted address; otherwise the required email delivery is typed skipped. |

Heavy enforcement creates or reuses the generic event-wide occurrence inside the same transaction as the authoritative irreversible `EventModerationRecord`. The frozen audience cutoff is the record timestamp; stable source identity uses the moderation record and its source decision when present. The event id is used structurally for audience lookup, tenant-safe delivery ownership, and fanout progress. It is not written into attendee-facing title/body/entity fields, and the notification item has no route because `NotificationNavigationHelper` only navigates when entity metadata is present.

Authenticated event-report intake creates one linkless reporter receipt intent with a required in-app row and an optional email channel controlled by case-update consent and the user-visible trust-safety preference. That receipt contains only thanks and the snapshotted bounded SLA hour window; it excludes reporter evidence and fingerprints, provider metadata, event-private data, and internal identifiers. Anonymous intake creates no recipient intent because it has no persisted recipient authority. Triage, assignment, decision capture, and provider sync do not notify recipients by themselves. Local and Coop decisions instead converge on `ExecuteReportDecisionCommandHandler`: an exact durable enforcement receipt is required before one serializable completion transaction may update the report/case and materialize reporter notifications. `NoViolation`/`Duplicate` produce generic no-action copy; `LightModerate`/`HeavyRedact`/`WarnOrganizer` produce generic action-taken copy; `Escalate` produces no reporter notification; and `NeedsMoreInfo` produces one required linkless in-app follow-up plus optional follow-up-consent/preference-gated email while remaining explicitly non-final. Because in-app delivery is required, an anonymous report, missing/deleted reporter, or inactive/missing tenant membership prevents `WaitingReporter` and execution completion; the receipted execution remains resumable in `CompletionPending`. With an active persisted reporter, missing email address, verification, preference, or follow-up consent instead creates a typed skipped email delivery alongside the required in-app row, and dispatch skips queued SMTP if consent is later withdrawn. `WarnOrganizer` also requires a generic linkless in-app warning for every effective active event owner, with optional preference-gated email; a standard unsubscribe control is not an event/content link. Report-driven moderation records retain exact `SourceReportId` and `SourceReportDecisionId` traceability, but recipient copy never contains reporter text, report IDs, provider payloads, provider case IDs, moderator identity, reason codes, reviewer notes, event titles, slugs, URLs, or invented response actions.

Moderation commands never call SMTP or synchronously enumerate recipients. Light moderation resolves the user-controllable trust-safety preference before creating attendee inbox rows and has no email channel. Heavy redaction bypasses preferences because its generic, linkless availability notice is required by server-owned policy; the asynchronous occurrence worker creates the in-app row and either durable SMTP work for a current verified persisted address or a typed skipped required email delivery.

## SSE Refresh Hints

`GET /api/notification/stream` is an authenticated `text/event-stream` endpoint. It emits `notification-refresh` events with a minimal payload: `UnreadCount`, `HasUnread`, bounded `Reason`, and `GeneratedAt`.

The browser client uses same-origin cookies through `EventSource`. The API response disables request timeout, sends `Cache-Control: no-store`, and sets `X-Accel-Buffering: no` so reverse proxies do not buffer the stream. The existing 60-second bell polling remains the fallback. Treat SSE as a refresh hint only; notification content and read/archive/snooze state still come from the authenticated notification APIs.

## Browser Web Push Safety

Web Push carries generic refresh/navigation hints only. Durable authenticated `Notification` rows remain the content and state source of truth; payloads do not contain notification titles, bodies, email addresses, tenant data, or access tokens.

Flood prevention is layered:

- The server sets a bounded `TTL` for every send and stops retries when the dispatch expires.
- The Web Push `Topic` header coalesces pending refresh messages for the same subscription/category at the push service.
- The service worker uses one stable notification `tag` with `renotify: false` so already displayed app notifications replace instead of repeatedly alerting.
- A visible same-origin window receives a refresh message and no OS popup.
- If three app notifications are already displayed, the service worker closes them and shows one generic summary.
- Subscription writes accept only bounded HTTPS endpoints and correctly sized Push API key material. The delivery adapter re-resolves endpoint hosts, blocks private/loopback/link-local/metadata destinations, and refuses redirects before sending, so browser-supplied endpoints cannot become an SSRF path.

`Topic` and `tag` are deliberately separate: `Topic` controls queued transport delivery; `tag` controls displayed OS notification replacement. The service worker validates navigation as a same-origin relative path and focuses an existing app window before opening a new one.

## Email Boundary

In-app notifications are separate from SMTP email delivery:

- The notification feature does not call `IEmailService` or the SMTP implementation.
- Actor-subscription fanout creates in-app `Notification` rows only; it does not send email digests or SMTP messages.
- Light moderation attendee fanout creates in-app `Notification` rows only. Heavy moderation creates a required in-app/email delivery graph through the generic occurrence worker; only its durable `EmailDispatchOutbox` row may later reach SMTP.
- Actor-subscription and registration fallback fanout consult the in-app preference matrix before creating non-required `Notification` rows. Disabled non-required categories skip row creation after dedupe checks and before persistence.
- Event-report intake and completed decision execution create explicit recipient delivery graphs; controllers, provider callbacks, and moderation commands still never send SMTP directly.
- `docs/EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS.md` documents direct SMTP delivery, including preference-based skip behavior for direct `EmailDispatchOutbox` rows, and explicitly states notification-to-email fanout is not implemented.
- Do not claim email digests, SMTP delivery, external delivery tracking, or email unsubscribe behavior for in-app notifications.

## Unsupported Claims To Avoid

- Permanent deletion.
- Mark-as-unread.
- Email fanout from notification records.
- Public user-to-user actor subscriptions.
- SSE as delivery truth or as a replacement for notification list/detail APIs.
- External delivery receipts or delivery tracking.
- Event-session deep links unless a matching route is implemented.
