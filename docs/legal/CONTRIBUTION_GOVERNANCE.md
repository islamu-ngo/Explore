ABOUTME: Summarizes CLA research, owner decisions, and unsafe workflow patterns to avoid.

# Contribution Legal Governance Decision

> **Audience:** Maintainers | Legal reviewers | Contributors | AI agents
> **Status:** CLA-only decision implemented; operational draft pending legal review and repository settings verification
> **Owner:** Platform/Ops | Contributor Experience | Legal reviewer
> **Last Verified:** 2026-05-31
> **Source Anchors:** `docs/CI_CD_GOVERNANCE.md`, `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, `dev/active/enterprise-ci-cd-hardening/enterprise-ci-cd-hardening-tasks.md`

This document records the legal contribution gate decision and automation threat model. The active agreement is [legal/CLA.md](../../legal/CLA.md).

## Current Decision

| Question | Current Answer |
|---|---|
| Legal posture | CLA only. Every non-bot contributor must sign the ISLAMU Event CLA. |
| Inbound scope | Broad copyright and patent license grant to the ISLAMU project steward so ISLAMU Event can be maintained, provided, sold, sublicensed, or relicensed under alternative terms when sustainability, enterprise, nonprofit, humanitarian, public-sector, procurement-restricted, hosted-service, or social-impact needs require it. |
| Enforcing workflow | `.github/workflows/cla.yml` validates pull request and issue-comment metadata with `contributor-assistant/github-action`, pinned to a full commit SHA. A pre-flight `actions/github-script` step (also SHA-pinned) short-circuits the full action when all commit authors are already signed or allowlisted. |
| Approved legal document | `legal/CLA.md` is the active CLA v1.0 operational draft, pending final legal review. |
| Signature storage | Same-repository signature JSON at `signatures/v1.0/cla.json` on the dedicated `cla-signatures` branch, plus GitHub PR/comment audit trail. |
| Token model | Default `GITHUB_TOKEN` with explicit write scopes for same-repository signature storage, pull-request comments, issue comments, and statuses. |
| Bot allowlist | `dependabot[bot]`, `github-actions[bot]`, `renovate[bot]`, `codecov[bot]`, `*[bot]` (GitHub App bot suffix convention — safe because all GitHub App accounts use `[bot]` suffix), and `web-flow` (GitHub Web UI commit identity). The prefix pattern `bot*` remains not approved. |

## Research Summary

### ContributorAgreements.org

ContributorAgreements.org frames contributor agreements as one possible legal strategy for open collaborative projects, not a universal requirement. Its stated goal is to reduce legal risk and transaction cost by providing standardized, adaptable agreements.

Key points for this repository:

- Contributor agreements are complementary to outbound open-source licenses; they help projects receive and use contributions before outbound licensing.
- The site explicitly notes that contributor agreements are not necessary for every legal strategy.
- Legal enforceability across jurisdictions is difficult because copyright assignment, exclusive/non-exclusive licensing, moral rights, employment authorship, signature formalities, and patent scope vary by jurisdiction.
- Patent scope matters for software projects because many FOSS licenses include outbound patent grants; the inbound contribution policy should intentionally decide whether it needs patent license or patent pledge language.
- The site provides informational material only and is not legal advice.

### Agreement Chooser

The agreement chooser is a tool for selecting contributor license agreement terms. It can inform drafting, but it does not replace legal review or project-owner approval.

For this repository, the chooser should be treated as research input only. Do not copy generated or sample text into production without legal review.

### CLA Assistant Hosted Service

The hosted CLA Assistant service stores a CLA in a Gist, links it to a repository, and asks contributors to accept the CLA during pull requests.

Operational considerations:

- Hosted signature storage and privacy terms must be reviewed before use.
- Contributor identity, signature metadata retention, and deletion/revocation policy must be explicit.
- The hosted service is convenient but creates an external dependency for an enterprise release gate.

### `contributor-assistant/github-action`

The GitHub Action can check CLA or DCO status from pull requests and can store signatures in the same repository, a remote repository, or a private repository.

Important constraints:

- The repository was archived by its owner on 2026-03-23 and is read-only.
- The README examples use `pull_request_target`, write-capable permissions, same-repository signature storage by default, a broad `bot*` allowlist example, and an unpinned version tag example.
- If this action is selected anyway, the project must decide whether to accept archived-maintainer risk, fork/vendor it, or replace it.
- The action must be pinned to a full commit SHA, not a version tag.
- Same-repository signature writes must not target protected source branches unless the owner explicitly accepts that risk.

### GitHub `pull_request_target`

GitHub documents that `pull_request_target` runs in the base repository context and can run even when a pull request has merge conflicts. That makes it useful for metadata/status/comment workflows but dangerous for untrusted fork code.

Repository rule:

- `pull_request_target` is allowed only for the CLA metadata/status workflow described here.
- A `pull_request_target` workflow must not checkout, build, test, cache, restore packages, run scripts from, or otherwise execute pull-request head code.
- Fork PRs must not receive deployment secrets, registry write credentials, OIDC tokens, or write-capable build/test credentials.

## Decision Options

| Option | Benefits | Risks / Open Questions |
|---|---|---|
| DCO only | Lightweight, common in open source, no separate agreement storage if signed-off commits are enforced. | May not satisfy desired patent/license scope; requires contributor education and sign-off checking. |
| CLA only | Explicit contributor agreement and signature evidence. | Higher contributor friction; needs approved agreement text, storage, privacy policy, and automation. |
| CLA plus DCO | Strongest provenance evidence. | Highest friction and operational complexity. |
| Inbound=outbound only | Lowest friction. | May not satisfy enterprise legal risk posture or patent/license requirements. |

## Required Approval Checklist

- [x] Project owner chooses CLA only.
- [x] Inbound copyright and patent scope is documented in `legal/CLA.md`.
- [x] Actual agreement text exists at `legal/CLA.md`.
- [x] Signature storage location, access model, retention period, and privacy note are documented as repository signature JSON plus GitHub PR/comment audit trail.
- [x] Automation token model is explicit `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions scoped to the CLA Assistant workflow's signature, comment, and status operations.
- [x] Bot allowlist is explicit and contains only known trusted bots.
- [x] Archived-action risk is accepted only for the pinned `contributor-assistant/github-action` CLA workflow and tracked as a migration risk; the SHA pin prevents silent action drift.
- [x] `pull_request_target` threat model is implemented as metadata-only validation of the trusted base branch.
- [ ] Branch protection status-check requirement is added only after the workflow is stable.

## Threat Model Requirements For Future Automation

`.github/workflows/cla.yml` must continue satisfying all of these requirements:

- Use only metadata/status operations on `pull_request_target`.
- Do not checkout repository code from the pull request head.
- Do not run build, test, restore, cache, package, or script commands from untrusted contributions.
- Use least-privilege permissions; raise `contents` only if approved signature storage requires it.
- Do not write signatures outside the approved `signatures/<cla-version>/cla.json` path on the configured signature branch (`cla-signatures`).
- Pin every external action to a full commit SHA with same-line version comment.
- Avoid prefix-based wildcard bot allowlists (such as `bot*`); the suffix pattern `*[bot]` is approved because it matches only GitHub's standard App-account naming convention.
- Write a clear PR status/check named `Contributor License Agreement` that can later be required by branch protection.

## Current Contributor Instructions

Every non-bot contributor must sign the ISLAMU Event CLA in [legal/CLA.md](../../legal/CLA.md) by posting the exact CLA v1.0 signature comment on the pull request.

Required pull request comment:

```text
I have read and agree to the ISLAMU Event Contributor License Agreement v1.0, and I confirm that I have the right to submit my contribution under it.
```
